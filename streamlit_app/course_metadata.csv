1006314,Financial Modeling for Business Analysts and Consultants,"What is the aim of this course?
As a business analyst or a consultant, you will have to from time to time create financial models. They are a bit different than business models. In business models, you go into details of operations and you focus on getting the links on the KPIs. Those models are usually done for internal purposes, to manage in the right direction the business. Financial models on the other hand are more for external users. You concentrate on creating a picture of the business in a standardized, understood by everybody way. You also want to create financial statements: profit & loss statement, balance sheet statement, and cash flow statement.
On top of that, you use financial statements for valuation purposes.
The most typical situation when, as a business analyst or a consultant, you will have to prepare such a model is connected with selling or purchasing a company. You may be doing it on the sell side or on the buy side.  Financial modeling is done as a part of strategy projects, turnaround projects, and due diligence.
I willNOTteach you everything on financial modeling because it is simply not efficient (and frankly you don’t need it). This course is organized around the 80/20 rule and I want to teach you the most useful (from a business analyst/consultant perspective) ways to go as fast as possible from rough description to working model in Excel that you can make more and more complicated.
The aim of this course is that you are able to do a financial model of the business as fast as possible.
If done properly, this course will transform you in a few days into a pretty good business analyst who knows how to create fast and efficiently financial models.
This course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses onUdemywere already taken by more than224 000 studentsincluding people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.
I teach step by step on the basis of Excel files that will be attached to the course.  We will go through a real-life example of a business and create the financial model for it. To make the best out of the course you should follow my steps and repeat what I do with the data after every lecture. Don’t move to the next lecture if you have not done what I show in the lecture that you have gone through.
I assume that you know basic Excel so the basic features (i.e. how to write formulas in Excel) are not explained in this course. I concentrate on intermediate and advanced solutions and purposefully get rid of some things that are advanced yet later become very inflexible and useless (i.e. naming the variables).
To every lecture, you will find attached  (in additional resources) the Excel shown in the Lecture so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you in your work.
Why have I decided to create this course?
This course is a part of my attempt to help business analysts and consultants gain fast useful knowledge that will help them excel at their work. I have done 10 other courses that will help you become a great business analyst or consultant. I have covered already: hacks and tricks in Excel, business modeling, market research, management productivity hacks, and others. Now you have the opportunity to learn financial modeling in Excel
In what way will you benefit from this course?
The course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you do the analyses as well as the quality of the conclusions coming out of available in your company data. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will know:
What is the difference between business models and financial models?
How to model cost positions and balance sheet positions?
How to create on the basis of these financial statements: profit and loss statement, balance sheet statement, and cash flow statements
How to make sure that there is integrity in the model?
What analyses and conclusions you can draw from the financial model?
You can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.
How the course is organized?
The course is divided currently into 10 sections and will be adding new sections to address other important issues. Currently, you will find the following sections:
Introduction.We begin with a little intro to the course
Modeling of Profit & Loss account.In this section, we start by showing how to model cost positions (except for Depreciation)and how to create on the      basis of this a profit & loss statement
Capex and Depreciation.  Capex and Depreciation are some of the most difficult elements that you will model in Excel. Therefore, we have created a separate section devoted just to this subject. In this section, you will learn how to follow specific groups of assets, track their gross and net value, and calculate depreciation.
Working Capital. Working capital is crucial to the business as it defines how much money you have to have engaged in the business. I will show you how to model      specific positions of Working Capital
Debt.  You may need external sources of financing for the company. I will show you how to model loans and get the necessary info to create a balance sheet later.
Equity. In this section, I will show you how to model equity and all relations with shareholders
Balance sheet modeling. Here we get everything together to model the balance sheet statement.
Cash flow modeling.  Here we get everything together to model the cash flow statement.  Here we will check the integrity of the model as well.
Analyses of the Financial Model.  In the end, on the basis of a ready model, I will try to draw conclusions that will show us whether the business we have been analyzing is interesting or not
Valuation. In this section, I will show you the main valuation methods. We will look at DCF and the Multiplier method
Business modeling. In many cases, you will have no time to do a full financial model. In such situations, you may resort to creating a business model. A business model will usually have only a P&L statement. In some cases also simplified the Cash Flow statement. In this section, we will see how you can create such models. You can also get access to more than 30 models. You will see how to model e-commerce, marketplace, real estate, subscription businesses, and many more.
You will also be able to download many additional resources
Excels with analyses shown in the course
Links to additional presentations and movies
Links to books worth reading
At the end of my course, students will be able to…
You will master financial modeling in Excel at the needed for a business analyst and consultant level
Understand the main challenges in financial modeling
Perform the analyses of the financial model
You will get a ready model that you can utilize for your purposes

What happen when trade went wrong, do we take the full loss of a Iron Condor if not how do we adjust our trade and minimize our losses. Likewise do we wait for expiry to capture all the potential profit or should we set a level to take profit.

1154754,Financial Modeling for Startups & Small Businesses,"Instructor Symon He hosts near daily LIVE office hours on TikTok 10:30PM PDT. Find him @SymonHe.
Reasons why you should create a financial model for your startup or small business.  A good financial model can help you:
Test your assumptions and verify key drivers of your business
Compare and contrast different business choices, like pricing models
Calculate the ACTUAL amount of capital you need to startup
Calculate your burn rate
Model out your user growth
Model out your expenses
Be more prepared talking to potential investors
And loads more.
Building a financial model isn't just a vanity exercise. When done right, it could help you better understand your business, whether it's a startup or an existing business you're growing.
But it's not easy and there is a right way and a wrong way to go about it.
Even if you have little to no finance background, if you're going to be starting or running a business, this is a skill you need to have.
A good financial model is an indicator of how deeply you understand your business model and market.  But building a good one requires the right tools and the right approach.
We're going to show you how to do that with a wide variety of examples and exercises.  But we'll also be teaching general best practices that will help you, no matter what you'll be building your financial models for in the future.

Why learn from us?
By signing up with us, you will be learning from two highly rated instructors that have a combined student count of over 750,000students and 100,000 reviews!
Check out our profiles and see that we take care of your students and deliver the goods.
Evan has extensive startup experience and previously worked as a venture capitalist, where he evaluated 100's of startups that trying to convince him to invest in them.
Symon also has startup experience in both tech and brick & mortar businesses. Previously he built tons of models while working in mergers and acquisitions as well as in private equity.  And he's helped dozens of startups build financial models across a dozen different business models and industries.
Together, we pull directly from our experience and put it in this course--in fact, two of the case studies use the ACTUAL financial models used to raise funding.  The other case studies are inspired by well known startups you're sure to recognize.

How is this different from Symon's Intro to Financial Modeling Course?
The Intro to Financial Modeling course taught by Symon He and Brandon Young is an introductory course on financial modeling that presents a general overview covering the topic and is more relevant to those who wish to explore finance as a career option or those who want to understandfinancial modeling in acorporate context.
This course is all aboutfinancial modeling for startup businessesso it's more geared towards entrepreneurs or business owners who want to better understand the key drivers of a new business.
There is almostzero overlap.  Even though both courses introduce a lemonade stand as an example, those examples and models are quite different as they serve very different purposes.
What if I don't have any finance or Excel background?
No worries! This course isn't an Excel or Finance course, although you will learn a bit of both.  We focus more on the rationale and the logic of modeling specifically for startups or growing businesses, so you can take what you learn to other spreadsheet tools.
But it will take practice.  You won't get better just watching the videos.  That's why have lots of practice exercises and sample models for you to learn from.
What will I be able to do after I take your course?
After taking our course, you will be:
Able to confidently build financial models for your startup or new business from scratch
Able to apply the best financial modeling practices and techniques
Able to read and understand other financial models by looking at lots of practice models and case studies
Able to leverage financial modeling to help you make smarter choices about your business.
Able to learn a new skill set that you can take with you for any and every business venture you take up in the future.
Why lemonade stand example?
Because learning how to model on its own is tough enough but learning it while also having to learn a new business model makes it even harder.
But, even with a simple business model such as a lemonade stand, you'll be surprised by how complex and sophisticated the analysis could become.
And since this is all about modeling for startups and new businesses, this example is different from the one in the Intro to Financial Modeling course.
After the simple lemonade example, we cover 7 distinct case studies involving different business models in different industries.

You have absolutely ZERO risk.

1142570,How I Learned Stock Trading (and How You Can Too),"10 Stock Trading Principles Quotes
Stock Trading Quote 1:

“Whatever moves fast always appeals to me. I have learned patience and how to sit tight”

Stock Trading Quote 2:

“When a stock is going up no elaborate explanation is needed as to why it is going up”
Stock Trading Quote 3:

“Prices, we know, will move either up or down according to the resistance they encounter. For purposes of easy explanation we will say that prices, like everything else, move along the line of least resistance. They will do whatever comes easiest, therefore they will go up if there is less resistance to an advance than to a decline; and vice versa.”
Stock Trading Quote 4:

“Real movements do not end the day they start.  It takes time to complete the end of a genuine movement”
Stock Trading Quote 5:

“All I had to do thereafter was sit tight and let the market run its course, knowing if I did so, the action of the market itself would give me the in due time the signal to take my profits”
Stock Trading Quote 6:

“I think the clearest summing up of the whole thing was expressed by Thomas F. Woodlock when he declared: ""The principles of successful stock speculation are based on the supposition that people will continue in the future to make the mistakes that they have made in the past.""”
Stock Trading Quote 7:

“Fear and hope remain the same; therefore the study of the psychology of speculators is as valuable as it ever was. Weapons change, but strategy remains strategy, on the New York Stock Exchange as on the battlefield.”
Stock Trading Quote 8:
“At. first, when I listened to the accounts of old-time deals and devices I used to think that people were more gullible in the l860's and '70's than in the 1900's. But I was sure to read in the newspapers that very day or the next something about the latest Ponzi or the bust-up of some bucketing broker and about the millions of sucker money gone to join the silent majority of vanished savings.”
Stock Trading Quote 9:
“I knew he had been in the Street for years, way back in Civil War times, and somebody told me that he was a very wise old codger who had gone through so many booms and panics that he was always saying there was nothing new under the sun and least of all in the stock market.”
Stock Trading Quote 10:

“I trade on my own information and follow my own methods.”
Have you ever wondered what the best stock traders do differently?
Did you ever wish you had studied some of the famous traders?
Did you ever wanted to learn the Jesse Livermore Trading System?
Did you ever wanted to learn Jesse Livermore Rules?
Did you ever wanted to learn from the best stock market traders?
Have you ever wondered who are the most successful stock traders?
Did you ever wanted to learn Jesse Livermore rules?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is a course that studies some of the most famous andsuccessful stock tradersin history.  We will learn from thesegreat stock tradersand what makes them thebest stock tradersto study in terms of their trading strategy.  I think theseworld-famous stock tradersdid a couple of things differently than most of the traders of our time.
Also, in this course we will talk about how a successful trader looks at the stock market and we can learn also learn how to be a good stock trader from thegreatest traders.  I don’t believe that this is an easy way to learn about stocks, but if are willing to learn from the mistakes of these most successful traders of all time I think you too can become a better trader.
Even if are an expert in the market I think using some of the approaches from thegreat traderswill take some learning to trade stocks in a different way.  I think you would also look at the market in a different way after learning from these great traders.  In addition, we would also look at thebest individual stocksthat were traded as part of a case study by learning from thebest stock tradersin history.
What you will learn:
You will gain a historical context of the time periods of the great stock market traders
We will talk about the concept of speculation and understanding how to trade stocks using speculation
How to be more self-reliant in your own assessment of the stock market
Learn stock trading from the perspective of the best traders
Learn Jesse Livermore Strategy
Trading might look easy since there is low barrier to entry.  However, I think the greatest traders of all time would have a different assessment of the stock market.  Their approach to the market I think is very different than what has been traditionally taught.  In this course we will look at Jesse Livermore's methods of trading in stocks as I have read all of the Jesse Livermore books.  I have thoroughly read both the Jesse Livermore How to Trade in Stocks and Jesse Livermore Reminiscences of a Stock Operator.  I especially liked the Jesse Livermore book Jesse Livermore How to Trade in Stocks.  As you probably know he was known as the great bear of wall street.
We will talk about the following:
How the methods learned in this class is applicable in all markets
In the stock market how holding for the long term is better for your portfolio
How not to be disturbed by the short-term fluctuations in the stock market
How you should not jump into any stock and rather wait to see if they meet your criteria
Livermore Quotes
2 More Stock Trading Quotes
Stock Trading Quotes on Waiting
""But I sat tight and instead of listening to my loudmouthed hopes or to my clamorous beliefs I heeded only the level voice of my experience and the counsel of common sense""
""And right here let me say one thing: After spending many years in Wall Street and after making and losing millions of dollars I want to tell you this: It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting. Got that? My sitting tight!""
I think it’s important to understand that the most successful traders of all time had a different approach to the stock market.  They were not trading in and out of the market every day.  They waited for the right stock to come along and if bought that stock then they weren’t disturbed the short-term stock market fluctuations.
We will cover the following:
How to become a successful trader in stock market by learning from these great traders
How to find good stocks to trade by creating your own method
How to build your own rules and philosophy about the market
How thinking for yourself and become self-reliant in the stock market is an important quality
This course will go in-depth into famous stock traders and their teachings as well their philosophy about the stock market.  We will also talk about how to build your own system with rules based on the teachings and ideas from the best traders of all time.  We will talk about how it’s important to be in the sideline most of the time.  You should not be in the market all the time because you need to guard your capital.
Great traderslooked at the stock market differently and their view of the market is often different than our own.  In the modern times, there is large weight given to looking at the fundamental information about the company and thinking there is a correlation between the stock and the company.  One thing to keep in mind is that the best stock traders in the world looks other factors that is directly impacting the stock itself.

Trading personality assessmentsand the importance of personality as well as temperament on your trading success.  We will cover some of the most frequently used personality assessments.  I think your trading style should match your personality.  You should ask yourself whether you are a technical trader or a fundamental trader and I think the different personality assessment will tell you more about yourself and I think based on that you can build your best trading strategy.
Case studyof two different stocks are going to be discussed in the course.  We will talk about at what point I started buying the stocks and when was it sold out.  I will also talk about the tool I used to automatically sell out of a losing stock.

This beginner course is a 15 chapter series of video lectures and textbook with an emphasis on financial accounting. It is imperative that you utilize both to get the most of the course.
It is designed to make accounting as simple and relevant as possible.

43319,Options Trading Basics (3-Course Bundle),"THREE COURSE BUNDLE - 10+ HOURS
The first 3 Options Trading Strategies courses are combined to create this bundle. To master the basics of Options, you really need all three courses.
A brief synopsis of the options trading strategies courses are provided below.
LEARN CALL OPTIONS AND PUT OPTIONS, OPTIONS FOUNDATION - TIME DECAY, IMPLIED VOLATILITY, OPTION GREEKS  BUYING CALL OPTIONS AND PUT OPTIONS - LIVE TRADES
SECTION I -  Call Options
Most people learning Options for the first time face too much jargon and complex language. This options trading strategies course use real-world examples (buying a house) to explain how a Call Option (Section 1) works in real life. This example should make it absolutely clear what a Call Option is in step-by-step details.
SECTION II - Put Options.
The Put Option is the ultimate ""protector"" of your portfolio, and in this course you can learn how Put Options work. It is the exact opposite of a Call Option. Put Options increase in value when the value of a stock or index drops in price. We define what a Put Option, and just like we did in the Call Option, we consider a real-world example of a Put Option.
SECTION III - Stock and Options combo strategies
In this section, three creative strategies are outlined for Stock investors to combine Options into their portfolio strategies.
·  Use Options to buy Stock at prices that are far lower than what the stock is currently trading for
·  Use Options to sell Stock at prices that are far higher than what it is currently trading for
·  Use Options to hedge a Stock position that you already own
SECTION IV - TIME DECAY
Time decay is a pivotal component of Options strategies. In fact, time decay alone is responsible for the majority of advanced option strategies. In this part of the options trading strategies course, we are going to study the concept in detail. Options are ""wasting"" assets, and they lose value every day. The buyer gets hurt from time decay and the seller benefits from it. And time decay becomes more exponential as we approach expiry of an Option. It is also the great equalizer between the profiles of a buyer and seller of Options. Time decay is the great equalizer in the risk / reward profiles of buyers and sellers of Options. Several intermediate and advanced strategies are based on selling premium (option sellers) and these positions make a profit due to time decay in the value of these options over a period of time.
SECTION V - IMPLIED VOLATILITY
Implied Volatility is the ""wildcard"" in Option prices. Ignore it, and you will pay a price. In fact, it's so important we have at least four different varieties - Volatility, Implied Volatility, Historical Volatility, and Future or Expected Volatility. We use the real-world examples to explain the concept of Volatility in simple terms. Then we study how Volatility is quantified in Stocks and Options. And how Volatility finds a back-door to embed itself into Option prices. Implied Volatility considerations are critical when choosing between a buyer and seller profile. We break this complex topic down into simple terms and show you an example of NFLX and CAT options that should make it absolutely clear what this is all about.
SECTION VI - OPTION GREEKS, DELTA, GAMMA, VEGA, THETA
If you're the pilot of an aircraft, the Greeks are your instrument panel. If you don't manage your instrument panel properly, well...you get the picture. Understanding the Greeks are absolutely critical to every Option position. We break this course into easy to understand chapters for all the four Greeks - Delta, the king of all Greeks. Gamma - the silent operator. Theta - every Option seller's dream. And Vega - Watch out for this one.. Most beginners to Options tend to ignore the Greeks. Master the Greeks and you'll shave off months of learning curve. Not to mention, you can then fly your aircraft on ""auto-pilot"" (with help from the Greeks).
SECTION VII - OPTIONS MARKET STRUCTURE
The Options market has a number of terms that we need to be aware of. Starting with terminology differences like ""Long"" and ""Short"", we look at all the details that go into the Options market. We explain the important processes like Exercise and Assignment, as well as things like Expiry series, Bid-Ask spreads, Brokerage and transaction costs and various other details. What is Open Interest and why is it important, and what is the role of a Market Maker. We study the different Order types and which ones are important for the average investor, and which ones make sense in different situations. We also discuss Regulation T Margin as it applies to Options as well as Portfolio margin.
SECTION VIII - BUY A CALL OPTION (CHIPOTLE MEXICAN GRILL)
Buying a Call Option is the most basic of all the Option strategies and is the most efficient strategy to optimize a bullish outlook on a stock. In this options trading strategies course, we take the example of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and show how the trade played out. We analyze the rationale behind entering the trade, the risk/reward profile, chart analysis and point of entry, choice of expiry and ""moneyness"" of the Option, time decay considerations, margin requirements, profit expectations, exit criteria, Greek analysis, its Profit and Loss profile and various other considerations. We provide a 360-degree analysis before trade entry. This is a real trade and over 15 days, and we navigate the trade to its exit point.
SECTION IX - BUYING A PUT OPTION (FXE EURO ETF)
Buying a Put Option serves two purposes - exploit a bearish move in the stock or be the ultimate protector of your stock. In this part of the course, we take the example of the Euro ETF (FXE) and show how the trade played out in about 25 days time. We analyze the rationale behind entering the trade, the risk/reward profile, chart analysis and point of entry, choice of expiry and ""moneyness"" of the Option, time decay considerations, margin requirements, profit expectations, exit criteria, Greek analysis, its Profit and Loss profile and various other considerations. We provide a 360-degree analysis before trade entry. We show you how to ""let your winners run"" in a controlled manner.
SECTION X - STRATEGY AND OPTIMIZATION
The Option strategy optimization course brings all the 4 Options strategies together. The 4 strategies are comprised of 2 bullish and 2 bearish strategies, but how and when should we choose a particular strategy over the other. We create a helpful ""4 strategies box"" to distinguish and connect one strategy to the other. Most importantly, what are all the considerations before we choose a strategy. Our choice of strategy depends not only on what the stock is currently doing, but also on various market externalities as well as a few key Option metrics like Implied Volatility. This course also provides a sneak peek into advanced Option topics like the VIX (Fear index""), trade simulation as well as trade adjustment parameters.
SECTION XII - SINGLE OPTION ADJUSTMENTS
This options trading strategies course studies the need for Option adjustments, and why adjustments are as critical to the success of your position as good entry or analysis. We consider all the four basic strategies - the Long Call, Short Call, Long Put, and the Short Put and look at various adjustments to these positions if they get into trouble. Every investor has a ""pain point"" - this is the point at which they adjust their position. Applying a rigorous approach to this pain point enables investors to control risk while maximizing the opportunity to profit. The course also discusses various details like early adjustments, over-adjusting and adjusting profitable trades as well as the importance of the investor's outlook for the stock when considering adjustments.
This bundle consists of  Courses
Course I - Introduction to Options- Learn about Call Options and Put Options is a detailed step-by-step explanation of Options, Call Options and Put Options with theory and practical application with Apple (AAPL) Options

Unfortunately, many traders have never heard of the greeks and yet they jump into options. 
This puts them at risk later, much like a pilot would 
experience flying in bad weather without the benefit of instruments. 

This class is designed to teach you how to trade options correctly. After learning about Delta, Gamma, Theta & Vega, you will be able to put on great trades. You will be able to easily adjust trades that are not working as expected (option repairs). You will be able to understand whether remaining in the trade is good or bad based on the time decay (theta) experienced daily. What could be better than learning how to avoid losses and maximize profits?
The delta of an option will also tell you how likely (statistically) an option is to being in-the-money. In other words, the options market gives you the answers to all of the questions you could possible ask. If a stock is at $50/share. Then you can with the click of a mouse find out how probable it is that the stock would be at 45/share, 50/share or 55/share over the next month! When I first learned what the professional traders know it blew my mind!

151668,Introduction to Financial Modeling,"This course will teach you how to use two years of historical income statement data and two years of historical balance sheet data to build a fully integrated financial statement model.It is designed for those new to financial models.
Section 1will introduce the accounting equation and the three primary financial statements in the context of building a financial model. The content starts with the accounting equation, which is the single most important concept in accounting. The remaining three videos introduce the financial statements one at a time with a focus on the relationships that are important as you build financial models.
All of the material is provided via video-driven instruction with notes in pdf format to help follow along.
Section 2will walk through integrating the three primary financial statements and creating a five-year projection. The first video provides a quick overview of the process. It is an easier process to grasp if thought of as a series of steps. It will also make it easier to measure progress as you work through the longer video. The video in Lecture 2 will walk you through the process of building the model cell by cell.
Because you are walking through the entire process of building a model, the video in Lecture 2 runs long: 35 minutes total. My advice would be to download the excel template attached to this lecture and build the model as the video progresses. Building the model yourself is the best way to fully understand the process.
In my opinion, if you want to build a strong financial modeling skill set, a thorough understanding of how an integrated financial statement model works is one of the most important things you can learn.
The last video in this section will explain circular references and how to fix broken models. It can be incredibly frustrating to finish a model and realize that it does not ""balance."" This video will help avoid that frustration.
I hope the content is useful to you! Please feel free to email me (peter@ASimpleModel.com) with any feedback.

44836,Option Spreads and Credit Spreads Bundle,"COURSE BUNDLE - OPTION & CREDIT SPREADS STRATEGIES
Details of this bundle are provided here, but you may find more information on the individual course pages.
SECTION I - PHILOSOPHY AND DEFINITION OF SPREADS
We introduce option spread strategies in this module. Options spreads sit right in between the 4 basic Option positions and the more Advanced level Option strategies. The Spread is the bridge between the basic Option strategies and the advanced strategies. In fact, most advanced strategies are composed of the spreads we cover in this course, so this stuff is the key. For the busy professional, Spreads offer the right mix of reward and risk. All 4 vertical spreads introduced in this course are extensions of the 4 basic Options. Spreads add an element of cost control and / or risk control to individual Options positions. Master the four Options Spreads, and you would have acquired a skill that can create consistent monthly income. Additionally, you'll be well on your way to mastering the advanced Options strategies.
What you will master
Advantages and disadvantages of single Option strategies - Long and Short
How Spreads tackle the negatives of individual Options
With Spreads, you can now be a seller of Options
The meaning of ""defined risk"" Options investing
Spreads help you control your costs and risk exposure
What are the differences between credit and debit spreads
Control risk and costs without compromising on Probability
SECTION - II REAL LIVE TRADES ON THE 4 OPTION SPREAD STRATEGIES
THE BULL CALL SPREAD
The Bull Call Spread is an extension of the Long Call Option. When you buy a Call Option, you are bullish. The Bull Call spread maintains the bullish element of the Long Call while controlling your costs and has a limited losses profile. Of course, everything is a compromise. But you would probably be willing to make this compromise. We explain why this spread is called a Bull Call spread, and how to address any confusion from these strange names. The risk-reward profile of a Bull Call spread is very favorable. We define why the Bull Call spread is a Debit spread, and study its Profit and Loss diagrams in detail. We put a real trade on IBM and we navigate the trade for a couple of weeks.
THE BEAR CALL SPREAD
The Bear Call Spread is a credit spread, and we explain why credit spreads are a viable way to assuming an Option seller's profile. The Bear Call spread limits your risk. We study the role of Probability in selecting credit spreads as well as implied volatility considerations and time decay. Time decay is a key component of credit spreads and the Bear Call spread can be an excellent way to generate monthly income. All spreads can be part of the busy professional's playbook, but credit spreads can be especially attractive. We analyze the right criteria for credit spreads, including the selection of the expiry series as well as the individual Options itself. We put a real trade on Amazon (AMZN) and track, monitor and adjust this trade until its exit.
THE BEAR PUT SPREAD
The Bear Put spread can be a powerful strategy for bear markets. The Bear Put is an extension of the Long Put Option. The Bear Put has some specific features, which make it a very attractive spread, and we dig deep into these characteristics. We put a real trade on Netflix (NFLX). The risk reward characteristics of Bear Put spreads are very attractive as its losses are limited. The Bear Put, just like the Long Put is a Vega positive trade, so this trade can optimize a bearish move as well as any upside from implied volatility changes. The choice of expiry series, time decay effects and the choices of individual Options are also important.
THE BULL PUT SPREAD
The Bull Put spread is a flat to bullish that profits primarily from time decay, but can also profit quicker from a move to the upside. Its important to pick the right strike prices for the Bull Put spread, as is a thorough analysis of the stock's chart and support levels. In this course, this is what we do - we pick Google (GOOG) as our candidate for the Bull Put, and analyze past price action, support levels and put on a successful Bull Put spread.
MONTHLY INCOME STRATEGIES PRIMER
If you have a regular job, then you need strategies that allow you to focus on your job, but yet create a somewhat stable and reliable income stream from your investments. In this PRIMER, we dig deep into credit spreads and understand why being an Option seller (risk defined of course - no naked selling) may not be that bad after all.
CREDIT SPREAD STRATEGIES - ADVANCED CREDIT SPREADS
SECTION III - Selection Criteria for Credit spreads
Consider this course as""Advanced Credit Spreads"". Both these spreads are dissected to convey an advanced level of knowledge and skill in using these credit spreads. Everything from the ideal credit spread trade setup, trade management, adjustments and exit. You're expected to know what a Bull Put and Bear call spread is.
If you have a regular job, then you need strategies that allow you to focus on your job, but yet create a somewhat stable and reliable income stream from your investments. In this course, we dig deep into credit spreads and understand why being an Option seller (risk defined of course - no naked selling) may not be that bad after all. We analyze Probability, Time decay and Volatility considerations and come up with some pretty good stuff.
These spreads form the foundation blocks of""Monthly Income"" strategies. And not surprisingly, all advanced strategies like Iron Condors or Backspreads use some variation of the Bear Call or the Bull Put spreads. Anyone wanting to create a consistent monthly income of 2% to 5% will use these strategies as part of their ""Income"" portion of their portfolio.
SECTION IV - Live trade entry, Management and Exits
What you will master
With Spreads, you can now be a seller of Options
The meaning of ""defined risk"" Options investing
Cutting-edge trade entry analysis
Selection of the right expiry series
Selection of the appropriate strike prices
Volatility considerations
Setting the optimal ""width"" of the Spread
Set your monthly target that can still let you sleep at night
Optimize Time decay, Probability and Premium collection variables
Set ""pain points"", and plan the exact nature of adjustments
Setup trades that require little monitoring
Why you can be wrong on direction and still make a profit
Ideal strategies for losing positions
How do you handle your position when your short strike prices are in danger

920604,Intro to Financial Modeling,"Instructor Symon He hosts near daily LIVE office hours on TikTok 10:30PM PDT. Find him @SymonHe.
Arun Mohan - 5 Stars
“The experience was an enlightening one as I was a novice in Finance and Excel and this Class was best fit for me. I could understand everything as the instructor took time to explain at a good pace and patiently introduced excel as well as accounting methods. Looking forward to getting acquainted with more of Finance.”

Ethan Wong - 5 Stars
“The course was designed very well, with clear explanations of the topic matter. Having the instructor show you everything step-by-step was very useful for learning. Also, having the excel spreadsheets to practice on was perhaps the most useful thing for me.”

There are THREE things you need to do in order to learn financial modeling:
1.         You need to understand the key concepts of Finance
2.         You need to understand the relevant features & techniques in Excel
3.         You need to be able to put both of those together in practice.


You're reading this because you have an interest in learning financial modeling for your work or a desire to get into corporate finance.

We did too many years ago.

But when we first started out, we wasted a lot of time and effort learning useless and unnecessary information and techniques.

It didn't have to be as painful and time-consuming as it was.

That's why we created this course,  so you can avoid making the same mistakes that we made and learn financial modeling fast with no wasted effort.

You DON’T have to learn everythingabout finance or Excel to become proficient at financial modeling.

You just need to know theRIGHT concepts and the RIGHT toolsin each to get started.

Now why should you learn from us?

I’m proud to say that I have an MBA from Stanford University and have worked on many commercial real estate properties across a dozen asset types in multiple markets. I even helped create the underwriting standards for a 2000-store private restaurant chain, helping them open new locations around the world.

And as alicensed broker and real estate consultant, I've helped many private clients with locating, evaluating, and structuring investment opportunities including multi-million dollar commercial property acquisitions and 1031 exchanges.

My co-instructor, Brandon Young, has a Masters in Real Estate Finance & Development from the University of North Carolina Charlotte as well as a Masters in Finance from Tulane University. He has over a decade of combined financial and real estate experience, including acquisitions and development.

We've been living and breathing in financial models for practically our entire careers.

Andrés Soto - 5 Stars
“A really good course for beginners. Right now I understand everything.”

Henry Taatjes - 5 Stars
""great instructors, great content”

Brady Burba - 5 Stars
“After reaching this point I see the training is going deeper into Excel and how to utilize the many tools and formulas Excel offers, without training on topics that are not relevant to my needs. Thank you!”

What if I don't have any Finance or Excel background?

No worries! This is an introductory course and it assumes ZERO prior knowledge or experience.  It is condensed because we've curated only the most relevant and useful topics to get you going fast.

What will I be able to do after I take your course?

After taking our course, you will be:
•           Able to confidently speak to key finance, accounting, and modeling concepts
•           Able to use over a dozen of the most useful Excel features & techniques
•           Able to construct three distinct financial models from scratch

What’s with the lemonade stand?

Learning Excel or finance on their own is tough enough, and learning them at the same time can be extra challenging.  To further muddy the waters by asking students to learn an arbitrary business model would be unnecessarily confusing and a waste of time.

But even with a simple business model such as a lemonade stand, you'll be surprised by how complex and sophisticated the analysis can become.

What’s holding you back?

Are you afraid this course won’t work?  I promise you it will.

Are you afraid this course will work and you’ll actually have to start investing? I think that’s a pretty good problem to have.

Are you afraid it will take time and effort? It will. Real estate isn’t an easy business, if it was everyone would do it. But if you put in the work I promise you’ll see results.

Best of all, there is absolutely ZERO risk. Udemy gives you a 30-day money back guarantee to ensure you get what you pay for.

907444,SAP FICO For Beginners - A Guide to SAP Financial Accounts,"
You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of getting in SAP or more specifically, learning SAP FICO (which to be frank, gives you the key to ruling the SAP Functional Modules). Now that you have found this course, you have to look no further. I am an experienced SAP consultant and am very passionate to guide you through the journey of learning SAP FICO.
Since technology is changing every day, I have to learn something new every time. The best way that you can learn how to catch up is ""to work on it"".
Yet, nobody teaches in this manner and I suffer from the same pain when learning something new every time. Most courses are not designed to help you learn by example (immersion is the most potent way of learning in humans). Rather they bathe you with inapplicable information that you have to learn over and over again anyways.
This course is designed to cover all the basic concepts of SAP FICO and the syntax necessary for learning the advanced topics in SAP FICO. Even though SAP FICO can open the door to working with SAP HANA, SAP FIORI, and SAP BASIS and basically everything else with the word ""SAP"" attached to it, it has some new functionality and nuances that you have to cover and learn.
My job is to make this class a great and fun learning experience so that I can help you progress through your path to learning advanced SAP (whether it be just programming logic...classes....backends (boring) or doing fun stuff like Data Dictionaries).
In this course, I will walk you though SAP FICO Installation, and you will learn about data structures (we hear a lot about data, but how do we store it?),
However, only a few videos per section are focused on information. I develop the rest of the details of the data structures and syntax through exercises that I walk you through in the course. There are 2-3 lectures on solving tough exercises on each subject so that you can understand not only the syntax and how to the program SAP FICO, but also what the crux of programming is in terms of how we solve problems programmatically and harness the POWER of SAP FICO.
There is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of SAP FICO finance and I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how to dominate the SAP world with the most SAP Module: SAP FICO.",Beginner Level,Business Finance,https://www.udemy.com/sap-fico-for-sap-beginners/,True

The big point about increasing lots is to do so in a way that the transaction becomes risk free. You should never be stopped out at a loss after you have added to your position.
The course is video based but contains excel models, simplifying and automating the calculations required to top-up on a risk free basis.
Although the course is mainly about the way of adding to your position on a risk free basis it does include bonus examples of successful trades using techniques such as Channel, Envelope and momentum trading. It also contains an 30 page eBook showing 7 ways you can find turning points in the Forex Market.
The course has over 2 hours of content and is structured to include most of the key areas to fully equip the student to understand the entire process which doubles your account in one trade.
Ways of building ""double in a day"" strategies, selecting currencies, selecting entry techniques, having the appropriate trading psychology and learning from experience will be covered.
This is not a get rich quick course at all and it will take time and practice to develop the trading skills described in the course after completion.

In the fortunate position to sell multiple credit repair books on Kindle and Amazon and Ebay. This is PASSIVE INCOME.
OK, HERE WE GO....
You need to understand what I tell you here.  If you don't this site is not for you.
1)  Information is the best product to sell online.
Why you ask?
a) No shipping
b) No inventory
c) Easily reproduced
d) Low to no cost- High mark-up
e) the internet is setup for this kind of marketing.  Amazon/Kindle/Ebay/Google were built on the platform of information products.  (we will talk about this a little later).
Think about all these guys selling course's on whatever.  It's for a REASON.   The only cost is hosting and advertising.  Markup is extremely high.
There are millions of examples...
Ok so hopefully you understand this basic fact.
NOW I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THE #1 REASON WHY INFORMATION IS THE BEST PRODUCT.
""IT IS YOUR PRODUCT""
This is so so so so important.
Imagine selling a product on your site that the customer can buy from anyone else.
You sell T-shirts that customers can get from any other site.  These other sites have buying power and can get better wholesale prices.  You are the small guy trying to compete.
Frankly it's a joke.  Try sourcing ""sunglasses"" wholesale and creating a site to sell them.  You won't even be able to buy them wholesale for what they are being sold at retail because of the buying power of these established guys.
These established guys also have thousands of reviews.

CREDIT REPAIR INFORMATION IS ONE OF THE BEST INFORMATION BASED PRODUCT.  IF NOT THE BEST
Why you ask?
1) A lot of people are looking for credit repair information.
2) People are willing to pay for credit repair information.
3) Credit is sooooo important to people when they are denied something.  So it is highly valued.
4) Secretive in nature.
5) Specialized

588764,Stock Options Day Trading Mindset for Success,"What sets truly successful stock options traders apartfrom those who never realize their dreams? Is it a particular set of habits or special rules? An increased appetite for risk? Skill at charting? Plain old smarts? No doubt each of these factors plays a part in a day trader's achievements, but perhaps underlying all of these differences is a particular and profoundlypowerful mindset.
The fundamental difference between the wildly successful and the merely mediocre stock option trader is not any inborn characteristic or individual learned behavior, but how we think about skills and learning in general.
Can People Really Change?
Some folks, it seems, think that, basically, when it comes to skills and abilities, you get the hand you're dealt, and that's that. You are, however smart you are, however hard working, and there's little to nothing you can do to change these fundamental characteristics of your personality. That's called a ""Fixed Mindset"".
Other people know differently. Those with the opposite view, called a ""Growth Mindset"", believe that with effort, training and perseverance, you can expand your knowledge, broaden your daytrading skills, improve your odds, and overcome reversals. The key tosuccessful tradingis not inherited talent, or skill, but good, old-fashioned hard work on their skills and attitudes. Guess who ends upmore successful?

In a lengthy and fascinating article in INC . com, Dweck wrote: ""It's all about your mindset.Successful daytraders tend to focus on growth, solving problems, and self-improvement, while unsuccessful people think of their abilities as fixed assets and avoid challenges.""

Learn how to form strategic partnerships with major companies that will benefit your business tremendously
Understand how you’ll be evaluated when you walk into that boardroom
Building relationships with Fortune 500 companies early on is essential to build credibility for your business. Imagine how many doors will open when you can say that you partner with Amazon, eBay or Google.
Learn exactly how the CEOs, heads of Mergers and Acquisitions and heads of business development companies of Fortune 500 companies evaluate companies to buy, understand what it is that they are looking for.
This course teaches you from my experience running the M&A team at eBay for five years. I met with hundreds of entrepreneurs and invested over a billion dollars of capital. You’ll learn from real life examples and I’ll share exactly what I was looking for in companies and how I evaluated teams.
To illustrate the principles of this course, we’ll look at different type of acquisitions and different ways that entrepreneurs were successful in selling their companies. I’ll also share specific case studies of companies that failed to be bought and explain what went wrong and what the mistakes were so that you can avoid these.
These are all going to be pragmatic case studies, I’m not going to teach you any theory, nothing academic, this is a practical course, I teach the same that I would teach someone who I’d bring on my team at eBay.
Course content
I’ll start by teaching you everything you need to know before you’ve even started a company or if you have a small startup already.
I’ll then explain why your leadership will determine the destiny of your company by studying top entrepreneurs who have sold their companies or raised billions of dollars like Kunal Bahl, CEO of Snapdeal, the largest eCommerce marketplace in India.
Next I’ll dive into why companies get acquired. We’ll look at why eBay bought Paypal and why Google bought Youtube. We’ll look at the synergies and how you can find these for your company.
I’ll also teach you how WhatsApp managed to get bought by Facebook for $19B and what that can teach you about getting the most money for your company, stuff that you won’t find in any finance books.
Finally, I’ll tell you exactly what not to do, how not to pitch your company and the most common mistakes I see entrepreneurs make.  We’ll look at why acquisitions fail, what can we learn from eBay’s unfortunate foray into telephony with Skype and eBay’s almost purchase of…well that’s a secret but I can still share the pitfalls with you.

43441,"Master 'Technical Analysis and Chart reading skills Bundle""","TECHNICAL ANALYSIS, VOLUME ANALYSIS AND CHART READING MASTERY BUNDLE
Take your understanding of Technical analysis, Volume analysis, Chart reading skills and Smart Money to nothing short of ""Mastery"" with this bundle
MASTER TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Technical analysis has become extensive in recent years. We study the psychology of technical analysis and why they work 60 to 70% of the time. There are several categories of technical analysis - Price indicators, Support and Resistance levels, Momentum indicators, Volume indicators, Oscillators and Statistical price movement indicators. We cut through all the noise and show you why there are 4 or 5 indicators you should study and that's all you really need to make informed entry and exit decisions. Technical analysis is a self-fulfilling prophecy and gives deep insight into crowd behavior.
What you will master
What is Technical Analysis and why is crowd psychology an important factor in markets
Why does technical analysis work only 60 to 70% of the time
Why are Price indicators called ""lagging"" indicators
What are potential ""leading"" indicators
A study of Moving averages and which ones are helpful
What are the best indicators for short, medium and long term trends
Why do we need a ""confluence"" of indicators to make a decision
Why the Bollinger Bands are a cool indicator
Adjusting technical indicators to match your trading timeframe
Why technical analysis ""works until it doesn't""
SECTION 1
Lecture I -  What is Technical Analysis
Technical analysis is primarily a study of Crowd psychology and crowd behavior. If a certain number of people act in unison at a certain time, and other people can observe this group of people taking a certain action, then they are motivated to join in. And it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Technical analysis is a very powerful force in the markets, but it has limitations. This Introductory lecture explains these details.
Lecture 2 - Crowd psychology and Crowd behavior
What is crowd psychology and why does it matter ? In this lecture, we study the S&P 500 Index over the last 20 years, and also observe a certain technical pattern that is currently playing out textbook-style. How could this pattern impact the markets this year ?
Lecture 3 -  Limitations of Technical Analysis
What are the limitations of Technical analysis - when does it work, and when does it not work. Knowing when it does not work is as important as knowing when it works.

SECTION 2
Section 2 is a detailed discussion of all the types of Technical analysis indicators. You have various kinds - Price Indicators, Momentum indicators, Statistical and Volatility indicators, Support and Resistance, Volume indicators and Oscillators. Each of these indicator types are broken down in detail as well as insightful tips on their usage and interpretation.

SECTION 3
Section 3 is a complete case study set of 5 stocks -
1) Apple (AAPL) - 1 Year Chart. And how AAPL gave 3 points of entry for the perfect Bearish trade.
2) Priceline (PCLN) - No clear long-term signals, but a short term bearish trade could be played out.
3) Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) - an absolutely amazing Statistical indicator gives away the perfect ""Long"" signal
4) The Gold ETF GLD - Hidden inside a very bearish chart is the potential for a reversal trade
5) And on the Google (GOOG) charts, we can study the battle between the Bulls and Bears at a recent breach of Google's all-time high.
Applying correct Technical Analysis techniques can set you with a fantastic trade entry. If you get your trade entry correctly, you have just increased your chances of a profitable trade a whole lot.

VOLUME ANALYSIS AND TRACKING SMART MONEY
Volume is perhaps the most under-rated indicator in the markets. Volume shows the activities of the big hedge funds and proprietary desk traders,  players we often refer to as ""smart money"". Good volume analysis shows critical points at which markets turn around, when activity levels are low or high or whensmart moneyis active or inactive. In this technical analysis course, we analyze various stock charts, and combine volume analysis with price action. Volume also provides a storyline to the markets. Constructing this storyline correctly is critical in terms of trade entry and exits.
Smart Money or Big money has always tried to (legally) manipulate the markets to their advantage. Their goals are to conceal their activities as much as possible. But Volume is one indicator they cannot conceal. In many ways, this technical analysis course levels the playing field for the average retail investor. Once you take this course, you'll know what to look for, and you'll be in a position to track smart money as they're entering a Stock or they're running for the exits. And your objective is to ""follow the smart money"". When you position your trades in harmony with the money flows of smart money, you're adding a whole layer of high-probability characteristics to your investing activities.
This is an exciting course!

What you will master
Why is Volume the most under-rated indicator
Identify the activities of smart money precisely
""Swim with the tide"" - increase your odds of success
How to read long term and shorter term charts
Identify points of major market reversals (before they happen)
What is Distribution and Accumulation
Put short term price action in context of longer term charts
All of this explained in simple terms
Study of various charts on various timeframes
SECTION IV
In this Section, we explore why Volume is a critical indicator to study, and why this is the only indicator that clearly shows the activities of Smart Money. What can Volume analysis tell us about activity levels in the markets. Volume is sometimes referred to as the ""fuel of the markets"", and this is very true. This Section also defines some of the rules of ""Smart Money"". These rules form the basis for the games and that Smart Money play, and the tactics they deploy to manipulate the markets to their advantage.

SECTION V
This section is a deep-dive into the methodology for spotting and tracking ""Smart Money"" using Volume analysis. A perfect timeframe for analyzing these activities was during the period preceding the financial crisis of 2007/2008 and the period after the bottom in March 2009. And there is no better instrument to study this than the S&P 500 Index itself. This section is a fascinating and shocking analysis of how we could spot Smart Money doing the following -
- Start selling in March 2007, about 6 months before the top in October 2007
- They sold (""distributed"") for about 9 months with barely a move in price
- Ran the bear market down to their liking
- Start ""accumulating"" stock by the end of 2008
- Finished accumulation phase over a period of 9 months
- Are running the Bull market right now to their liking

SECTION VI
Detailed case studies of major stocks analyzing Smart money activity points -
1) BIDU - Smart Money is in, and they are not leaving
2) CAT - Similar to BIDU but more choppiness
3) FSLR - Gave a clear signal of smart money entry
4) NFLX, PCLN and FXE - Gave various signals for entry and exit
5) Silver Case study - Smart Money left Silver and has not come back yet.

The answer?Proper tax planning.
Proper tax planning is perhaps the most important step to the promised land of financial freedom. The strategy is simple- the more income that you generate at a tax free or a lower tax rate means the more money you get to keep. If you reinvest this money, your money works for you, generating a stream of passive income ultimately accumulating wealth.
There seems to be this misconception that the wealthy are cheating the system. This is simply not true! The wealthy simply structure their income to take advantage of the favorable provisions outlined by the government.
Anyone can apply these strategies- not everyone knows about them.

We look at overall market  correlations with the VIX since the index was created in the 1990's. The VIX  may be called a Volatility Index, but it acts more like a Fear index in the  markets.

These are the returns in his single stockoption portfolio. Read on to find out how you may reap these kind of gains this year with this best kept secret from the academicgeniusside of Wall Street.
In this course you will be introduced to theone perfect option strategy.  The buzz is palpable ...
Dear fellowinvestor,
My name isScott. I am a successful academicexpertin options with extensive actual experience as a professional trader for my own account. By successful I mean that I am able to makesignificantamounts of money for my family. I watch over our finances as a financialsteward.
Sometimes I am asked how I was able to become sosuccessfulin such a difficult game.
I became obsessed with finance from tradingfutures. This led me to obtain a Ph.D. in finance from theUniversity of South Carolina.
This was no smallfeat.
The Ph.D. infinanceat the University of South Carolina accepts just two students every two years from large application pools. The two applicants who win admission have tuition waived forfree.
Competitionis fierce because we live on pensions during the 5 years it takes to earn a doctoral degree in financial economics. Nobody with a finance Ph.D. from anAACSBbusiness school owes student loans.
TheAmerican Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)provides internationally recognized, specialized accreditation for business and accounting programs at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral level.
Senator Elizabeth Warrenshows that a university professor with a highly quantitative Ph.D. such as finance almost never endures bankruptcy because of this.  It also helps that wecommandhigh pay.
But If You Thought Medical School Was Tough ...
For this reason about ahundrednew doctorates in finance become new professors each year at the worlds best business schools.
Anotherreasonwe make more is that we are such hard workers in finance.  This is one of the last old world styleapprenticesystems.
We work 365 days per year as research assistance to the brightest financial academics in the world.
The finance faculty from whom we strive to earn adoctoratein finance owns us. After years of grinding through tomes of mathematicalderivationshalf of us become finance professors with medical school faculty sizedsalaries.
That's because the other half pumps up our market price by starting onWall Streetat $350K per year or more.
One of us in myclassdid just that. The last family photo we saw was that of his wife draped over theMaseratiin front of their mansion in the Hamptons.
When I caught up to him thissummerhe corrected me. It was not the Maserati, they hassoldthat the year before.
She was draped over the newLamborghini.
I chuckle when aWolf of Wall Streetmisleads individual retail investors into believing that we teach because we can't trade. The reality could not be further from the truth. Go back and peruse my personalresultsI have posted above.
These results have been audited byTD AmeritradeandOptionsXpress.

Stop reading investment newsletterrecommendationswritten by drunks, con artists and imbeciles.  Learn to find your option trades on yourown.
Sidestep these bad option trading strategies that will bleed your account dry faster than aone armed banditon the Las Vegas strip.Losingstock option strategies are routinely touted by marketing cheats, scoundrels and incompetents operating major investment newsletters.
And it's official that I am at the top of theWolves of Wall Street enemy list. My shocking revelations of Wall Street's investment newsletters have boosted me right up tonumero uno.
Now,making #1on this list is not such an easy feat.
After all, professorBill Christieof Vanderbilt university stirred up quite a list of “enemy"" brokers, directors, presidents and the CEO.  Dr. Christie's research revealed that theNASDAQwas ripping off millions of retail investors with illegally excessive transaction costs in the form of an artificially wide bid ask spread.
So how did I — another simple financeprofessorfrom a major state university — make it to the top?
Maybe it was my exposé on the investment newsletter industry that was featured in theCertified Financial Analysis CFA Digest. This research was published at the top of financial academia in the prestigious academic journalFinancial Management.
This crucial study showed that widely subscribed investment newsletters in theMark Hulbert Financial Digestoffer nothing but loss and emotional pain to their subscribers — despite routine claims of return percentages in the hundreds.
Study This or Go Broke!
It could be for this reason — or a dozen otherrevelationslike them. The kind Ipublishevery month in this course's bulletin, “Strategic Option Intelligence.""
Infact, I've been called the “most fearless financial academic in the world today.""
But you won't read my writing in anymainstreamfinancial press. They don't have the — well, let's just say theguts— to publish my insights and findings.
In short, I will bring you thefinancial storiesthat no one else will touch. These are stories that will shape your financialworldof tomorrow.
I will goanywhereand do anything to get the truth. And I willtellit to you, no matter who objects.
Myfearlessstyle has made me a lot of enemies — some of them in the highest places in the Wolves of Wall Street pack.
That is why theCFA Digestdid a cover piece on my research.
This mostprestigiousparagon of proper financial conduct felt that getting the word out about my research was of paramount importance to you.
Here Is the Student Response ...
""Dr. Scott Brown is one of the sharpest guys I know. Highly recommended.""  —Alex Green, New York Times Best Selling author of the “Gone Fishing Portfolio""
“Most newsletters and trainers want you just trust them that they will make you money. But Dr. Brown is a unique combination of academic prowess and street smarts skill. He is the man to take you from a mere patriot of others to a knowledgeable trader. If you want to add discernment to your tool box and make money in the process, you must learn from the Doctor."" —Joe Martinson, Los Angeles, California, USA
""Keep doing what you're doing. What you are teaching is 100% correct. Marketing is a tough business, especially with the plethora of BS out there on how easy it is to make money trading... Keep it real and grounded in facts and you should attract long term clients who will enhance your service. I really appreciate your efforts in sharing.""–F.M.

May the creator bless you with abundance of love, laughter and happiness!"" Sincerely,—Rajkumar Mehta

Was this your brainchild? What a great idea. Not only does it really cut through the burden of time and effort, but it seems to instill confidence in me, knowing I have a great place to start and drill down on these great possibilities that present themselves, and if I just follow along my criteria that you have instilled in me, we should be sailing together on a world cruise in a few years.I'm very happy to have found you,""—T.

Doc Brown Delivers Stories Others Are Afraid to Touch
If you look at my research you can see why the Wolves of Wall Street would like tosilenceme. My work shows that every penny spent on investment newsletter advice is money flushed down thetoilet.
That is because those who can makemoneyin the market won't bother with the technical problems of running an investment newsletter. Newslettereditorswho make enough writing an investment newsletter do so because they can't make money in the market.
And that is just what thenewslettersare trying to get you to do what they say when they write “buy this"" or “sell that."" Here is an actuallinethat just hit my mailbox,
“The true story of how this trader turned $2,000 into $10 million from his kitchen table, in 9 months."" Don't for a moment believe thislie.
If thesemarketerscan get you to take action in your trading account they know one thing for certain.
It will be asnapto get you to buy their next dud of an expensive annual fee investment newsletter, $5,000 course or $20,000 boot camp — glossed up with fancy promises and fancy sales copy writing. These marketers make their money selling shiny ideaswithoutregard to the true returns underlying each strategy.
The underlying economics of the newsletter industry I reveal to you is quitebizarre.
Investment newsletter subscriberslosemillions every year investing in bad ideas. Investment newsletter publishers makemillionsin annual subscription fees.
But now I have uncovered theultimatelie from the Wolves of Wall Street. This investment fib truly pukes up losses ofscandalousproportions.
Which Option Strategies Are Tailor Made For Those Born to Lose?
If you have ever been interested in options there are a few strategies you must immediately become aware of to avoid like theplague. These fundamental options trading techniques are guaranteed tolosestraight out of the barrel.
And they form the basis forcompoundoption trading strategies that expose investors to very big losses. Why are these strategies sopopularamong brokers as well as newsletter editors?
Compound option strategies don't just cause complexlossesthey also kick out vastly larger brokerage fees.
But the true returns to investors of thesestrategieshave been so hard to calculate that it was impossible to “prove"" the danger to investor accounts. So it was easy for investment newsletter marketers to falsely claim that thesehorrificoptions trading strategies actually made money.
Untilnow!
A seminal option trading article came out last year in the #1 rankedJournal of Finance.  This probing study proves that moststrategiestouted by the financial media are a sure ticket to the poor house. And the Wolves of Wall Street are biting their nails in hopes that you never learn thetruththat emerges from this article.

Many a times, it's seen that students are either not aware about the higher studies avenues available in Finance field or they are confused about certain programs.
CFA is considered a Gold standard in the Investment Industry and it is a global certification which is well recognised and rewarded. However, it's also a difficult goal to achieve and it's exam pattern and course of study are very different than most other courses and certifications.
Students may be better positioned to complete this program if they had more information about it, while such information is widely available on the Internet and even on the CFA official website, in no one place are all the answers of CFA aspirants consolidated.
I have therefore, launched this course to bridge this gap. Through this series of short videos, the student can get all the information they seek regarding the CFA program in a very short span of time and in one place.
The course is split up in two sessions, one for those who are indecisive about the CFA program and the other for those who have decided to go ahead with it.
To help you decide whether or not to do CFA by helping them answer questions such as What is CFA, Why Should you do CFA? Is CFA the right course for you?, What does it take to do CFA?, CFA Structure and course of Study and Historical pass rates.

717278,How to be a Profitable Forex Trader,"Trading in the financial markets is like a great game of chess. The amateur looks only at the board in front of them. The professional is already thinking 3 moves ahead. If we are going to trade well, then we have to be prepared for multiple outcomes. In other words, making money in the FX markets takes brains and not biceps.
This course on the ""psychology"" of trading is designed to give you the edge you need. There are things that you don't know that can hurt you. We have learned that trading is really all about limiting losses from the ""bad"" trades. Maximizing rewards from the ""good"" trades. While that is a simple concept it is incredibly difficult to achieve. Why? Because our mental make-up gets in the way. We must first recognize how we feel and are likely to act under certain circumstances, be that a profitable or unprofitable trade. Once we recognize the error in our decision making process, we can start to take corrective actions.
I have studied and traded the financial markets for almost two (2) decades. I traded for a New York based firm and ran their options division. I have seen the best and worst of traders. I am 100% convinced that it all comes down to the ""psychology"" of the trader. I believe the concepts taught in this course are invaluable.

808506,Candlestick Analysis For Professional Traders,"For the first time, a course that reveals the historical performance of all the classic Japanese candlestick patterns.
Candlestick charts are the number one way to present financial price data. I love them because they allow me to quickly and easily visualise the market and analyse recent price action before placing a trade.
Whether it’s in a particular stock, a currency pair, or a commodity, once you know how to read candlestick charts you can very quickly gauge strength or weakness in the market of your choice.
Now, candlestick charts have been around for centuries and there are numerous books and courses that detail specific candlestick patterns. Patterns such as the shooting star, the Doji and the Hammer.
However, most of these books and courses fail to address just how good these patterns really are.
On this course, not only will I teach you all about Japanese candlestick charts and how to find the most popular candlestick patterns, but I will show you the historical performance of 25 of the best patterns.
In other words, I’m going to show you which candlestick patterns are the best and which ones you should pay attention to in your trading. And I'm going to show you which ones you should simply ignore.
I’ve analysed 21 different futures and forex markets, over 100 stocks and I’ve made thousands of historical trades to see which patterns produce the most profitable results. And the results are indeed surprising.
In fact, the results suggest that some patterns are not profitable at all and I present the results clearly for you to see.
However, the results also reveal that one specific candlestick pattern is better than every other candlestick pattern that I tested.
On this course, you’ll learn precisely which candlestick pattern that is.
You’re also going to learn how to spot the candlestick patterns and how to incorporate them into your own trading and investing. Then, I put what we’ve learnt into action when I build a fully fledged trading system based on the best patterns found.
But that’s not all you're going to get.
Because, when you take the course today, you’ll also receive a number of bonuses.
Bonus 1:you'll get the A3 candlestick cheat sheet so you can quickly locate candlestick patterns by eye. You can even print this out and stick in on the wall if you want to.
Bonus 2:you’re going to get access to the accompanying eBook and all the tables of results.
Bonus 3:you’re going to receive the formulas that I used to code up each candlestick pattern. If you have the back-testing program Amibroker, you’ll be able to use this code to run an exploration and scan for the latest candlestick signals on your own machine.
So, if you want to learn how the professionals use financial charts and you want to take your candlestick trading to another level, just click take this course now and let’s get started learning about Japanese Candlesticks.

Qualitative factors will provide better insights into what will happen into the
future when combined with other methods of analysis.


We
will start off by learning about the business lifecycle. Then we move onto
power and competitive analysis. And finally we will end off the course with 3
quality case studies.

you only see text in their power point presentation, this
course will include animations, images, charts and diagrams help you understand
the various concepts.


I promise I will not be teaching generic unactionable
ideas like you must buy low and sell high. Also, this is also not a motivation
class where I preach to you that you must work hard to succeed, or you must
have discipline to profit from the market.


In this course, I will teach you exact
methods and frame work.

Esta inversión puede ser la diferencia entre generar más ingresos o quedar en la calle.
Claro está, que el cambio del que estamos hablando es de impacto general y mundial. Y a lo que nos referimos es que no solo si te desarrollas en esta industria te debe de importar Bitcoin y las criptodivisas. Este es un cambio que ofrece oportunidades sin precedentes a cualquier persona que haya utilizado dinero alguna vez para efectuar una transacción que prácticamente es cualquier persona en este mundo.
Hay incluso personas que están formulando sus tesis alrededor de Bitcoin y otras dedicando su vida a la tecnología que sirve como base de las criptodivisas.Es de interés también para economistas que analizan y se sorprenden de como las nuevas generaciones están cambiando las formes tradicionales de pensamiento y no solo se esta creando esta nueva base tecnológica sino que además los miembros más jóvenes están dispuestos a innovar y a ser los que tempranamente adoptan estos cambios revolucionado industrias enteras

""Amazing. He does not say one single thing without explaining himself. It's like listening to Mozart: his thought process is so well organized that if you were to play these lessons to a baby still in the womb, it would literally be born with a higher IQ.""
""I am not new to Elliot Wave Theory and I think this course is Excellent. The subject is complex and if you are interested in learning EWT this will provide you with a great ""practical"" starting point.""
Latest News: Indian Insight Founder & Instructor of this course, Yash Utmani was ranked 8th in Position Trading & 12th in Day Trading in Equities Segment in the last concluded edition of Pro Advisory Championship Competition, India 2016.
What is this course about?
This is a technical analysis course based on an advanced concept in technical analysis, popularly known as Elliott Wave Theory. Elliott wave theory was discovered in 1930s by Ralph Nelson Elliott and has survived the test of time. This is a complex tool within technical analysis, which can be difficult to understand initially, but once you start applying it you would be amazed with the insights for financial trading offered by this theory. The various financial trading examples shared with you as part of this course will convince you on this and demonstrate to you the power of technical analysis.
Why should you take this course?
This course will help you understand this advanced concept from technical analysis so that you can start applying it for short term trading or long term investing purposes or for any other financial trading. Throughout the course we share many examples from real life financial trading (many of them taken from our technical analysis research desk over years). These examples will demonstrate to you the practical applicability of all the concepts to different areas of financial trading.
As part of this course you will also learn the various technical analysis patterns associated with elliott wave theory. Some of these technical analysis patterns are complete financial trading systems in themselves that you can use instantly to trade profitably. Students who have some knowledge of classical technical analysis can also combine their knowledge with what they will learn in this course and can improve the accuracy of their trades substantially.
How is this course structured?
This course is structured into 4 sections:
1. Introduction to wave theory: Where we introduce you to elliott wave theory
2. Motive Waves: Where we explain the various patterns that represent trending markets
3. Corrective Waves: Where we explain the various patterns associated with corrections
4. Elliott Wave Rules & Guidelines: Where we explain the various rules & guidelines associated with elliott wave theory. These concepts will help you in correctly identify various patterns & set price targets for practical financial trading.
It is often said that Technical Analysis is useful only for short term trading. Nothing can be further from the truth.Advanced Technical Analysis concepts like elliott wave theory can be as effective for long term investing as it is for short term financial trading. The applicability of this advanced technical analysis tool across financial markets makes it one must have tool for all serious practitioners of technical analysis.
If you have some knowledge of technical analysis, this course will take your knowledge to a new level. If you are new to technical analysis then I believe this is best place to start your journey into technical analysis because you would have an open mind to advanced technical analysis concepts covered in this course that might be a bit hard to believe for more experienced technical analysis users. But don't worry the examples in this course will leave no doubt as to the effectiveness of this advanced technical analysis concept.
I have personally benefited immensely from learning these advanced technical analysis concepts and I believe not using technical analysis in your investing or financial trading journey will only make it harder for you to succeed. So if you want to learn this advanced technical analysis concept enroll now!",All Levels,Business Finance,https://www.udemy.com/technical-analysis-using-elliott-wave-theory/,True
42642,The Basics Of Volume Analysis,"VOLUME ANALYSIS AND TRACKING SMART MONEY
Volume is perhaps the most under-rated indicator in the markets. Volume shows the activities of the big hedge funds and proprietary desk traders,  players we often refer to as""smart money"".Good volume analysis shows critical points at which markets turn around, when activity levels are low or high or when smart money is active or inactive. In this course, we analyze various stock charts, and combine volume analysis with price action. Volume also provides a storyline to the markets. Constructing this storyline correctly is critical in terms of trade entry and exits.
Smart Money or Big money has always tried to (legally) manipulate  the markets to their advantage. Their goals are to conceal their activities as much as possible. But Volume is one indicator they cannot conceal. In many ways, this course levels the playing field for the average retail investor. Once you take this course, you'll know what to look for, and you'll be in a position to track smart money as they're entering a Stock or they're running for the exits. And your objective is to ""follow the smart money"". When you position your trades in harmony with the money flows of smart money, you're adding a whole layer of high-probability characteristics to your investing activities.
This is an exciting course !

What you will master
Why is Volume the most under-rated indicator
Identify the activities of smart money precisely
""Swim with the tide"" - increase your odds of success
How to read long term and shorter term charts
Identify points of major market reversals (before they happen)
What is Distribution and Accumulation
Put short term price action in context of longer term charts
All of this explained in simple terms
Study of various charts on various timeframes

SECTION I
In this Section, we explore why Volume is a critical indicator to study, and why this is the only indicator that clearly shows the activities of Smart Money. What can Volume analysis tell us about activity levels in the markets. Volume is sometimes referred to as the ""fuel of the markets"", and this is very true. This Section also defines some of the rules of ""Smart Money"". These rules form the basis for the games and that Smart Money play, and the tactics they deploy to manipulate the markets to their advantage.

SECTION II
This section is a deep-dive into the methodology for spotting and tracking ""Smart Money"" using Volume analysis. A perfect timeframe for analyzing these activities was during the period preceding the financial crisis of 2007/2008 and the period after the bottom in March 2009. And there is no better instrument to study this than the S&P 500 Index itself. This section is a fascinating and shocking analysis of how we could spot Smart Money doing the following -
- Start selling in March 2007, about 6 months before the top in October 2007
- They sold (""distributed"") for about 9 months with barely a move in price
- Ran the bear market down to their liking
- Start ""accumulating"" stock by the end of 2008
- Finished accumulation phase over a period of 9 months
- Are running the Bull market right now to their liking

SECTION III
Detailed case studies of major stocks analyzing Smart money activity points -
1) BIDU - Smart Money is in, and they are not leaving
2) CAT - Similar to BIDU but more choppiness
3) FSLR - Gave a clear signal of smart money entry
4) NFLX, PCLN and FXE - Gave various signals for entry and exit
5) Silver Case study - Smart Money left Silver and has not come back yet.",All Levels,Business Finance,https://www.udemy.com/volume-analysis-basis/,True

42640,Technical Analysis - A practical approach for trade entry,"
MASTER TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Technical analysis has become extensive in recent years. We study the psychology of technical analysis and why they work 60 to 70% of the time. There are several categories of technical analysis - Price indicators, Support and Resistance levels, Momentum indicators, Volume indicators, Oscillators and Statistical price movement indicators. This is again an area where the KISS rule applies - Keep It Simple S-----. We cut through all the noise and show you why there are 4 or 5 indicators you should study and that's all you really need to make informed entry and exit decisions. Technical analysis is a self-fulfilling prophecy and gives deep insight into crowd behavior.
What you will master

What is Technical Analysis and why is crowd psychology an important factor in markets
Why does technical analysis work only 60 to 70% of the time
Why are Price indicators called ""lagging"" indicators
What are potential ""leading"" indicators
A study of Moving averages and which ones are helpful
What are the best indicators for short, medium and long term trends
Why do we need a ""confluence"" of indicators to make a decision
Why the Bollinger Bands are a cool indicator
Adjusting technical indicators to match your trading timeframe
Why technical analysis ""works until it doesn't""

SECTION 1
Lecture I -  What is Technical Analysis
Technical analysis is primarily a study of Crowd psychology and crowd behavior. If a certain number of people act in unison at a certain time, and other people can observe this group of people taking a certain action, then they are motivated to join in. And it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Technical analysis is a very powerful force in the markets, but it has limitations. This Introductory lecture explains these details.

Lecture 2 - Crowd psychology and Crowd behavior
What is crowd psychology and why does it matter ? In this lecture, we study the S&P 500 Index over the last 20 years, and also observe a certain technical pattern that is currently playing out textbook-style. How could this pattern impact the markets this year ?

Lecture 3 -  Limitations of Technical Analysis
What are the limitations of Technical analysis - when does it work, and when does it not work. Knowing when it does not work is as important as knowing when it works.

SECTION 2
Section 2 is a detailed discussion of all the types of Technical analysis indicators. You have various kinds - Price Indicators, Momentum indicators, Statistical and Volatility indicators, Support and Resistance, Volume indicators and Oscillators. Each of these indicator types are broken down in detail as well as insightful tips on their usage and interpretation.

SECTION 3
Section 3 is a complete case study set of 5 stocks -
1) Apple (AAPL) - 1 Year Chart. And how AAPL gave 3 points of entry for the perfect Bearish trade.
2) Priceline (PCLN) - No clear long-term signals, but a short term bearish trade could be played out.
3) Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) - an absolutely amazing Statistical indicator gives away the perfect ""Long"" signal
4) The Gold ETF GLD - Hidden inside a very bearish chart is the potential for a reversal trade
5) And on the Google (GOOG) charts, we can study the battle between the Bulls and Bears at a recent breach of Google's all-time high.

Applying correct Technical Analysis techniques can set you with a fantastic trade entry. If you get your trade entry correctly, you have just increased your chances of a profitable trade a whole lot.

843854,The Complete Guide to Professional Trading with Elliott Wave,"Before I start off with the details of the course and how it will enable to achieve your speculative and financial endeavors, below is a list of few of the big moves that I have caught, live in front of thousands of my students over the years:
2022: LUNA Cryptocurrency Crash: Caught precisely at the turning point. (Watch free preview in Module 10: Case Studies)

2016 - 2021:On SPX:In June 2016, while recording lectures for this course I used live charts of SPX and forecasted upside movement from 2100 level, with extended target of 4169, which was achieved in April, 2021.(Watch free preview in Module 9: Predicting the future)

2017 - 2020: On GOLD:In Feb. 2017 when GOLD was trading around $1250, I made a public forecast of the upcoming bull trend with targets of 2000 plus, after 3 years in August, 2020 the market achieved the upside target.(Watch free preview in Module 10: Case Studies)

2018: On BITCOIN:When BTCUSD was trading around 6200 level in October, my analysis suggested possibility of move down till 3000 level. By December 2018, BTC had given a strong fall and reversed around 3122 level as per analysis.

2019:Multiple short-term moves captured on Crude Oil, Gold, Silver, BTC, EURUSD SPX, Nifty, NYSE Stocks, NSE Stocks in the Monthly webinar series called, “Applied Elliott Wave Webinars.”

2020: On CRUDE OIL:In the webinar conducted on 22nd March, 2020; I discussed the possibility of possible Negative prices in Crude as per my analysis with a possible target as low as -59$, it was relegated as at that time negative prices were not allowed.

However, in April, 2020, CME Group announced that they will allow Negative Price Trading. And what later transpired was something in a league of its own, as Crude Oil achieved the Negative Price level of-37.63$.It is worth noting here that I was ofcourse not aware that CME was going to allow Negative Price trading beforehand, and neither was I aware that the market will go so very close to the Hypothetical and previously impossible negative target of -59$.

All combined till 2023:Till date, out of the 241 Analysis published publicly, 206 have played out as per analysis, making the accuracy of my analysis and forecasts stand at 85.48% for 6 consecutive years.

It is worth noting here that in the forecasting industry where even an accuracy of even 60% in a year is considered high, I have achieved and maintained 80% plus track record.
That too in a way that is publicly verifiable by anyone, as all webinars are public andthe Track record sheet containing links of all the webinars is available in: Section 1 - Lecture 2,accessible to everyone without even enrolling in the course.
_______________________________________________

What have I achieved and what you can?
Before you go ahead and read more about the course and what's special about it, I would like to bring your attention towards 'Sections 12: Victories of a Day.""
In this section I have discussed a single trading session, where I made120% PROFITStrading Intraday.
While this is not the highest percentage return I have made in a day, but the overall hugenumber or trades in this single session (1995)and the twists and turns present a unique learning opportunity and hence I have chosen it.
This section cements the fact, that you are learning from an actual trader and also allows me with an opportunity to show off, what I have achieved and what awaits you, should you choose to master the concepts presented here.

_______________________________________________
My extreme emphasis on Credibility and Track Record
Popular brokers and independent researchers claim the number of successful traders to be anywhere b/w 5% to 3% of the total number of participants.
In this extremely difficulty business, it become even more important that I’m upfront about my own credibility.
I firmly believe that real credibility can only be known from something that is done in public eyes. And can be checked by anyone at any point in time, while in the past I have shared yearly Broker statements of P&L via Private webinars, those are never made public as they contain sensitive personal information.
Hence you see my emphasis and highlight of the 6-year consecutive Track Record sheet.
It is the first thing I have talked in the course as well as here in the Course Description.
_______________________________________________
Your responsibility as a learner
If you learn trading from someone, who does not know how to trade themselves, you will come out to be an even bigger looser.
Hence, it is your responsibility to check the credibility and verify the records before learning from me or from anyone else.
Just remember, it is your money on the line.
Now that I have said, what I wanted to, lets discuss what is this course all about and what you are going to learn here.
_______________________________________________
What is this course about?
This course is about thepractical applicationof Elliott Wave Theory, developed by Sir Ralph Nelson Elliott, according to which theprices in the stock market reflect the crowd psychology of humans, which being repetitive forms patterns. These patterns being recognizable on the chart give us predictive power.
In this course you will learn all about these patterns from thepoint of application in Day Trading, Swing Trading and Investment,also you will see how we can use the concept ofFibonacci Ratiosand the concept ofChannelingalong with some other concepts to add more predictive power to our analysis.
_______________________________________________
Who are you learning from?
Hello, this is your instructor, Neerav Yadav, founder of 50 Eyes Market Analysis.
I’m primarily a trader who started trading in Crude Oil Futures. In my progression as a trader, I have traded and tracked all major markets, including but not limited to:

Indices:SPX, DAX, NDX, DOW, NIFTY among others.
Commodities:Gold, Silver, Copper, Natural Gas and Crude Oil.
Forex Pairs:EURUSD, EURCAD, USDJPY, USDCHF and other major pairs.
Cryptocurrencies:BTC, Ethereum, Luna, Ripple among others.
Stocks listed on:NYSE (US Stock Market), NSE (Indian Stock Market) and MOEX (Russian Stock Market).
Apart from this, over the last 7+ years I have also worked personally with a great variety of Institution as well as trader. Including Dubai based Hedge Fund, retail traders who entered markets during Bitcoins massive bull runs, as well as Prop. Traders managing multimillion dollar portfolios.
_______________________________________________
What is special about this course?
Other than trading and training other traders over the years, I have also been conducting my own Private Research, on how to easily spot patterns in live market and simplify and analyze complex scenarios.

Pragmatic Approach:This is aPRACTICAL COURSE(on Elliott Wave Principles), that is I haveexplained all the concepts on live chartsrather than a meaningless slide shows.

Your trading style included:I have included various case scenarios throughout the course, some chart discussions depict Intraday Trade analysis, some depict Swing Case scenario while others discuss long term prospects from an Investors point of view.

Systematic breakdown:Throughout the course I have discussed the basic thought process in a systematic manner so that viewers can understand the complete application part.

In Section 7:Step by Step Deduction you will find the mentionof the concept of Point of Reference, a concept that I first coined and introduced when I was on my quest to make complex Elliott Wave structures simple.

In Section 10, 11 and 12:I have shared some of the techniques that I have developed for spotting trades early on.

Specifically in Section 12:“Victories of a day - 120% profits from a single day’s scalps”, which I consider the most important and most practical part of the course, I have shared my methods to spot strength and weakness as well as thepsychological limitations and how to overcome them in live trading environment.
I would like to make it very clear that, the Private Research I have shared here is only a small fraction of the complete body of work, however it is ample enough to speed up your trading journey by 2 years, if not more.
_______________________________________________
Final words
With all that being said, do note that Elliott Wave is no easy subject matter.
While I have done everything possible to simplify the concepts, it is required that you go through the course atleast 3 times or more to be able to make the most out of it.
Remember that everytime you repeat the course, your knowledge will build up and you will discover new things.
Ofcourse, after learning the contents here, a proper practice routine will be required to sterilize the knowledge.
For that you can refer to the second last lecture of Section 12, where I have shared how my routine which allowed me to practice and apply Elliott Wave for 20,000+ hours and how you can achieve the same.",All Levels,Business Finance,https://www.udemy.com/practical-trading-trade-stocks-forex-with-elliott-wave/,True

439362,"Professional Options Trading, Simplified","There are several option and financial courses out there. Most of them promise to teach you a set of strategies that can deliver huge profits with limited risk. The fact is, most retail option traders actually lose money. Sure enough, they might have a couple of successful trades at the beginning. But sooner or later, the odds play out, and poor trading techniques cause a cascade of errors.
The goal of this course isteach you the way professionals play. They don't lose money, they make a consistent profit. The profits might not be a 700% return on one trade, but rather, a daily 1% return in many. When you add the numbers up, you will see thatthe smart, patient trader actually wins the race at the end of the year.
The course will not be delving into non-essential information. You do not need to know about complex strategies that have very poor success records, or delve into excessive mathematics or chart reading. We havebacktested years of financial datato show which strategies actually, consistently, work. This is not our opinion, it is what the statistics show. As a result, we willonly focus on the top most statistically successful strategies,and will teach youwhen to use which,depending on themarket conditionsand yourpersonal trading profile.
At the end of this course, not only will you have solid knowledge about options trading, but you will have the benefit of knowing what works and what doesn't. You will know how to take advantage ofvolatility,the implied mathematicalprobabilities,and thetime to expiration. Oh, and you most probably be able to get back the money you invested in this course in one trade.

This course shows a few different ways of looking at Probability and how investors can create strategies to put Probability on their side.

SECTION II - DEEP DIVE INTO THE OPTION GREEKS

This course also takes a deep dive into the four Greeks - Delta, Gamma, Theta and Vega. We introduced these concepts in the previous module, but it is time to take their understanding to a new level.

Once you perform this Options analysis, you can immediately spot your weak points and you're prepared for them. Analysis and Simulation are as important as finding a good trade entry. In this course, we provide a complete roadmap to simulate every possible market condition BEFORE you put the trade on. This kind of analysis may take 30 minutes, but its well worth the time spent.

Starting in the '80s, banks have become huge financial supermarkets offering a wide range of different services and products. Employees in these large banks have developed specialized expertise in the area in which they decide to make a career.
Along with rapid developments in information technology this has resulted in large IT departments staffed by people without any particular financial and banking education.
For example: How was it possible that the 1929 financial crisis was repeated by the 2008 credit crisis? The outrage and confusion illustrates the knowledge gap of understanding what banks do, what happens on financial markets and what is needed to prevent a derailment of the financial sector.
Since 2005, I train people in the financial sector. To bridge the basic knowledge gap with an easy accessible tool, I have created this 2 hour video E-training at Udemy.
What can you expect - Example topics covered by this course:
Learn about money types and the role of Central Banks;
Understand the different bank types and their activities;
Get an overview of the 3 financial product categories to trade capital, foreign currencies and risk
Understand financial market products trading: how, why and by whom;

702278,The Big Volatility Short: The Best Trade On Wall Street!,"Volatility trades can be incredibly profitable if you know what you're doing. Consider the following pattern: high volatility always drops, given enough time. Think about this for a moment and realize that this pattern has worked every single time in the history of the stock market! I can't think of anything else that even comes close to that kind of perfect track record.
A winning strategy every trader should know
The core of this strategy involves making a protected bet against volatility when it's high. Why? Because high volatility always goes down, given enough time. That's what makes this such a powerful strategy. The ETFs that track volatility also have extremely steep decay profiles. Since we're betting against volatility, this gives us an additional edge. That gives us a strategy with 2 extremely powerful factors working in our favor.
Maximize Leverage and Safety
This course will take you from beginner to expert on volatility, the VIX, and the ETFs that track it. We'll also go over what to watch out for and some of the techniques I use for setting up volatility trades the right way. If we plan our trade setup properly, and manage our risk aggressively, we should be able to win every single trade we make. We also want to maximize both leverage and safety. I'll show you how.",All Levels,Business Finance,https://www.udemy.com/the-big-volatility-short/,True

418732,Hedge Fund Trading System,"In this free Forex trading system, you will discover how I trade for a living. It is not only me who is using this (or similar) trading systems. There are at least a few dozen of trend-following hedge funds that use the same approach to make money on the financial markets. I am sharing my knowledge with all new/experienced traders eager to learn a consistently winning trading strategy that has been working for me for the past 5 years. I would love to make this system accessible to as many traders as possible and that is why I wanted to make it free. I have tried to keep it as concise as possible, so not wasting your time with unnecessary details. In the end- time is money!
The goal of this course apart from showing you a trading system that has been working for me for a long time is to try to protect you from the dangers of the financial markets. I have been day-trading (unsuccessfully) for some time before discovering that longer-term trading is actually the only way to profit from the markets. I know a lot of you are extremely eager to make money quick, but this is not the point of this course. I would like to show you a system that works in the long-term. More and more people are trying to make quick money in the financial markets nowadays, but less and less are making money in the short term. As some of you already know- trading is a zero-sum game. In other words, for every winner there is a loser. That's what I will try to help you with- how to be on the winning side in the long-term.
I am sorry if my english is not perfect, but it is not my native language. I still believe that for trading there are no barriers and traders should follow their dreams. I will do my best to help you reach your goals (financial), but there is one thing I cannot do for you- I cannot teach you how to be disciplined! That is something that you need to discover yourself in order to be a successful trader...
OK. Back to the system- it is a simple trend-following discretionary trading system. I have included 10 videos and a trading manual. Please make sure that you read the trading manual before watching the videos. In this way, you would be prepared what to expect and would better grasp the trading system.
The biggest prize for me would be if I can help new/experienced traders become even more successful!
Last but not least- I would like to thank especially to 3 TRADERS that helped me become a successful trader and follow my dreams- Colibri Trader, Paul (a.k.a. The Flipper) and Brett!
For the sake of the course:
I am using the website Tradingview to show the charts. I do not want to be associated with any brokers, so that is why I am using a free trading website open to anyone. I am not here to make money by referring traders to brokers, although I would like to warn you to be careful when choosing one. There are a lot of bad seed out there. Lastly, I have done the trading manual easily downloadable here, so you can just get it with one click of a mouse.
When you are taking this course, it is not necessary to have prior experience in trading since I go over the basics in the beginning. But for a complete FOREX newbie, it might still be a bit tough to get all of the pieces of information in one go. I anyways try to be as simple to follow as possible. In the end, my trading system is straightforward and effective if one is using it correctly.

757450,Bulletproof Personal Finance: Expert Asset Allocation,"***Now with over 50% more course content. Get explosive information on market strategies... options... Bitcoin... and more, all for the same price.

Throughout the developed world there is an invisible glass ceiling above the middle-class... Keeping average people from getting ahead.
Mortgage debt... Auto debt... Credit card debt... Student loan debt... Rising costs of living... Exploding health care costs... Stagnant wages... Artificially low interest rates... Globalization... Automation... Robotics... Artificial intelligence...
It all conspires to keep the glass ceiling just overhead.
But there is a way out. Financial independence is more possible than ever in the Information Age.
You won't shatter the glass ceiling playing their game, however. To achieve financial freedom, you need a new game... a new set of rules.
You need a newperspective.
Simply contributing to a 401(k) or buying a basket of mutual funds just isn't going to cut it. Not in today's world.
You see, most of the conventional wisdom is dangerous when it comes to personal finance. There may be nuggets of truth in the mainstream messages... But they approach finance as if it were a static institution.
They do not explore money and monetary history. They do not analyze macroeconomic trends. They certainly don't cover the intricacies of the capital markets with central bank interventions.
Most conventional sources still parrot the same message:
Buy term and invest the difference... earn 6-8% a year in low-fee mutual funds... stop buying lattes... retire rich.
It sounds nice. And it sells books. But it doesn't work.
For one, you can’t earn 6-8% a year in mutual funds anymore. You will be lucky to break even. And you may even lose your shirt if you own the wrong assets.
And saving $5 a day by dropping Starbucks amounts to a whopping $1,825 per year. Do that for twenty years and you'll have $36,500... Which won't even fund one year of retirement.
You see, generalizations are deadly in the world of finance. There are just too many moving pieces.
You need a targeted investment strategy if you want to shatter the glass ceiling and achieve financial freedom.
At Bulletproof Personal Finance, there are two layers to this...
First, we want to spread our capital across a number of asset classes according to a targeted allocation ratio. Think of these asset classes as ""buckets"".
Cash... Precious Metals... Real Estate... Stocks... Bonds... and Bitcoin - we want to build strategic exposure to each asset class.
And this course will cover everything you need to know to build your own asset allocation model.
Next, we want to employ the best strategies within each asset class. We want to fill our buckets with strategic investments according to the financial climate.
That's where our advanced strategies come in. This course series presents strategies that will succeed in both bull markets and bear markets.
So, we want to build a strategic outer layer of asset buckets. Then we want to hone in on targeted investments to put into those buckets.
In his book titledAntifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder, Nassim Taleb defined antifragility as:the ability to benefit from shocks; the ability to thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors.
Our two-layer approach is all about building antifragility.
We want to build an asset portfolio that will protect our capital... benefit from existing macroeconomic trends... and generate big returns with a few key investments.
The goal is to gain financial independence - the ability to choose our own course regardless of what life throws at us.
And that means we need to be able to thrive as the world around us changes. After all, this universe is irrefutably marked by change and paradox. Nothing stays the same forever.
Bulletproof Personal Finance accounts for this with our two-layer strategy. The outer layer is all about fundamentals. The inner layer is all aboutdynamic strategies that work in any market and economic climate.
But it all starts with the fundamental principles.",All Levels,Business Finance,https://www.udemy.com/bulletproof-personal-finance-expert-asset-allocation/,True

How to Profit With The Insiders Without Breaking A Single Law
I will give you further proof of hidden stockfortunesfrom the years before 2010 deep into the last crash.
Had you bought right when the ""insiders"" did, you could have made$178,000,000in 5 years. Every $37,580investedbecame three quarters of a billion in just 60 months.
But how do yougetit? How do you getaccessto the information that would enable you to grow your money so quickly?
Simple. Enroll in this course rightnow!
There is a way to know when a stock isgarneringinside attention without breaking any insider trading laws. It's asecretI've been using with a great deal of success for several years.
I'll tell you about it in abit.
But before I reveal it to you, you need to ask yourself a ratherprofoundand deeply personal question: ""Is trading this way 'ethical'""
The answerdependson you.
Yes, you areprofitingusing a technique that detects and exploits possible insider activity. But the way you are obtaining your information is perfectlylegal.
You know nothing you're notsupposedto know. You're simply following atrendbeing set by people who most likely have information nobody else has.
If you're notcomfortabletrading this way, I fully understand. And I respect your position.
But if you're tired of insiders getting all theprofits...
...and you want to learn how tobeatthem at their own game — entirely within the confines of your laws — you'll want to read on.
Because in thewordsahead you'll learn how you can do it ... and could rack up some veryhandsomeprofits along the way.
Perhaps the Most Powerful Trading Secret on Wall Street
But first, let me tell you a little aboutDenny's (DENN).
I was doing my usual quarterly chart reading of the roughly 3,700 worthwhile stocks trading on theNYSE,AMEX, and theNASDAQexchanges. A highwaydinerstock named Denny's caught my eye.
As before with Ambarella, there was no earnings reportreleasedand none due for several weeks. There was noannouncement. Nonewsof any kind. But thevolumehad surged along with the share price.
I did some digging. I found that the company had re positioned itself as ""America's Diner"" under the hands ofFrances Allenwho was proven from the helm ofDunkins' Brands (DNKN).
Thespikein volume told us two things were highly likely:
As wordleakedout, people close to the situation snapped up shares. To us, this volume spike was as good as insiderinformation.
Even better. It wasperfectlylegal!
You can probably guess whathappened. Denny's share prices have risen over time from $2.25 then to $11today. In one month nearly 4 billionsharestraded hands. You could have more thanquadrupledyour money in less than 5 years.
But here's the thing. I knew that theinvestingpublic, ever hungry for good news and the next rags to riches story, was driving this stock higher than it deserved to go. The newCEOwas good news, but not great news.
Also theearningswere weak when I first identified this trade. But a few months later I noticed a significantimprovement.
Denny'scontinuedto rise.
Ride These ""Spikes"" For What They're Worth and Then GET OUT!
Denny's (DENN)andAmbarella (AMBA)are perfect examples of how you can profit following insiders using volume spikes and price trends.
But it's important to know that this is purely a timing strategy. It is not a buy and hold portfolio.
When a volume spike arises — and the research checks out — ride it until you see signs that the fervor is fading.
Then get out. Take whatever profits you may have.
Sometimes investors arerewardedwith 400% returns in a year — like the gains inAmbarella (AMBA)andDenny's (DENN). Other times they’llmake100% in a few months ...
or 1,000% in a few years, as you saw waspossibleabove ...
My point is, trading onvolumespikes requires you to employ a stock trader's most powerful weapon: discipline. You're only in for theup-elevator.
Usually the ride is quick or you arestoppedout. But it is never a ""buy and hold""situation.
Here’s something else toremember. Trading using volume and price is notpassive.
It isfast-paced. It isexciting.
And thescientificallyproven potential for big speedy gains are tremendous...

Let me give you another very recentexample.
Facebook (FB)is a large cap internet media company. Facebook held one of the biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) intechnologyand Internet history on May 18, 2012.
The stock immediatelyslumpedcrashing more than 50% over the next few months. Then in the summer of 2013Facebook (FB)traded above the $38 listing price on high volume and strong earnings.
Strangely It Rose On No News
In the end of the summer of 2013 the price had extended upward enough on consistent volume to merit atest purchase.
The price continued to climb so I bought more.
Over the next few months I scaled into a large stock position in Facebook. The price climbed even more and I replaced the shares with options.
This one trade would yield over a 140% gain on account by February of 2014.

Here is what some students are saying about this course:
____________________________________________________________________
""This course is excellent. Mr. Johnson breaks things down so I have an idea of what is being discussed in simple terms. For instance i looked at other materials before but he was the first to say what a pip is, a percentage of a penny. Simple. Now i wish he made the technical analysis longer, with the tools, like indicators, Moving Averages and Fibonacci Retracement. But he did give an overall look as to what each one is and their usefulness. Can't wait to observe the live trades, I am halfway thru and grasping it better than expected' -Astan Billings
""After finishing the course, I was amazed at howsimpleandpracticalthis course is. The amazing thing isit works. The best things in the world are simple. I like the way you make use of the fibs. This course will work for any trader who is willing to take a bit of time practicing what they have learned. The best thing is there are live trade examples. Lee thank you for making this course available for traders who are not there yet.""-Dave
""I am thoroughly enjoying this class. Lee Johnson presents the material in a very organized way. Just when I'm thinking now I need to understand something, it ends up being covered in the next lesson or so"".I would gladly take another class with him as the instructor.-B Brady
""Leedoes a great job breaking down what forex is and how to get started. Really well laid out, and great presentation. I enjoyed going through this"" -Brandon Hakim-Top Udemy Instructor

WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A GREAT TRADER:
Virtually all studies estimate that only 5% of traders succeed to a level where they can make a living out of it.  Only a small fraction of of that 5% will make the amount that would be notable in comparison to other average jobs.
Many reasons can account for this.  The unifying and underlying theme that binds all of those reasons have to do with some form of not knowing.  This course was specifically designed to address the biggest knowledge gaps to give traders the highest chance of success.  That includes people interested in trading, aspiring traders, struggling traders as well as traders who may already feel like they have everything covered.  The best traders are always seeking a higher level of knowledge.

482534,Ultimate Retirement: Build Your Own Dynamic Retirement Plan,"COULD IT REALLY BE POSSIBLE…
It's possible—It's up to you if you want to achieve it.
JOIN US INThe Retirement Master Course, AND WE WILL BE YOUR GUIDES ON THE JOURNEY TOWARD RETIREMENT FREEDOM!
Five reasons to take this course IMMEDIATELY:
SAY GOODBYE TO FINANCIAL STRESS…AND HELLO TO PEACE OF MIND, RETIREMENT SECURITY, AND FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE
Conventional retirement planning is backwards!
Your retirementmustrevolve completely around the income you can create each and every year after you are finished working full-time. It does not revolve around the mysterious “retirement number"" you so often hear. The real goal in retirement is sustainable spending—not portfolio value. This one change in how most approach their financial picture—is what makes all the difference!
Approaching it this way gives you a retirement picture based on real, hard, concrete facts and projections precisely catered toyourneeds. It does not give you pie-in-the-sky numbers, generic rules of thumb, and anyone's best guess as to what it truly means for your retirement years. Itdoes notgive you biased recommendations, questions of your financial security, or numbers so high you think you will never get there.
Instead, it gives you the exact plans, confidence, and peace of mind thatwhen you do achieve it—you can have the lifestyle you dream of. Learn how to do this!
Begin to enhance your retirement right now, no matter what experience or knowledge you might already have. This course is for everyone who wants to create their ideal life beginning now, and through retirement. No matter your age, income, or where you are in the world—this course is designed foryou.
That's because your retirement plan revolves aroundyou. In today's world, you can be in control of where your money is going, how it's being invested, and more importantly—in the driver's seat of retirement.
If you are willing to do the kinds of things that others won't—you can achieve the kind of results that others can't.
Do you want to sit on the sidelines—waiting, hoping, and relying on others for success? Or do you want to be in the game with your finances—in control of your success?It's a game you can't afford to lose.Remember—nobody cares more about your financial outcome, than you and your family. You owe this to yourself.
We know the challenges you face in the financial world. We've seen it all. Who do I trust? Where do I put my money? How do I plan for the future? I've been burned before, how can I avoid it again?
In our course, we will discuss the path that many are heading toward in their retirement…stressed out, worried, and working so hard they sacrifice their health at retirement. You will also see the path that far too few retirees are heading down…fully prepared, knowing what their life will look like at retirement, and making the necessary adjustments along the way in order to account for life's changing circumstances.This is where we want you to be.
You'll then move on to learning about the retirement fundamentals—essential concepts you need to know. We'll discuss the variables that will have the biggest impact on your retirement planning, the variables that most financial professionals do not even address or account for!
We'll go on to show the exact steps it takes for you to budget, plan, and project what your retirement years will look like. This is the fun part—it allows you to dream and correct for any shortfalls you might currently have—no matter your age. After that, we will present the course retirement calculators—combining everything you now understand in order to prepare your personalized retirement plan. This will show you what you are on track for, where to adjust in order to get what you want, and give you specific and actionable plans in order to properly move ahead.
We will present ways for you to make up the differences, accounting for areas where you might be lacking in right now. The course will show why the fees you are paying in your accounts are costing youMUCHmore than you probably think, what the alternatives are, and why the path that 90% of future retirees are headed is not the way to go (think high fees). The financial system today is a fragile one that looks great when things are going well, but will leave you high and dry when the first sign of trouble comes.We've seen it before—we don't want that to happen to you.
We will continue the course with the importance of your retirement. It starts with your thoughts—how much money do you want every year at retirement? Focus on that, set your mind to attaining it—then take the proper actions necessary to get there. It isn't all about just “thinking"" about what you want—butyourthoughts coupled with the proper action will put you over the top. The key is learning to combine these two components in the right ways—most people only have one or the other.
You will also learn how to find the proper financial advisor or professional, and how to best utilize their resources to your advantage.Your financial professionalabsolutely musthave your best interest in mind before their paycheck.That is vital. There are plenty of trustworthy ones out there if you take the time to find them. Learn how in this course.
Finally, we will give you the step-by-step game plan, including immediate action steps you can take right now in order to save a ton of money, start preparing, and be well on your way to the retirement life you want!
As a bonus—we will thoroughly discuss ways to speed up your retirement plans, or make up for lost time in our creative retirement planning section. This includes the three main inputs to your retirement calculation—save more, earn more, and increase returns. This section will provide tips and ideas for you to put to work immediately in either achieving your goals sooner, or altering your plans to line up with what you truly want out of your pre- and post-retirement life.
In addition, this course is constantly updated with the most up-to-date material.
You can access all of the course materials—including the lectures and class discussions—on your computer, through your iPhone or iPad, and on any Android phone or tablet.
On top of all of this…the course comes with a 30 day, no questions asked, 100% money-back guarantee. If at any time within 30 days you are not satisfied with the quality of the course, simply issue a refund and we will be happy to deliver.

738910,[Value Investing] Where White People Keep Their Money,"[Value Investing] Curtis Carrollfaces a group of inmates in San Quentin explaining that the only difference between the wealthy and poor comes from just four steps. Each is simple …
SaveLots.
ControlCosts.
BorrowPrudently.
DiversifyThoughtfully.
Academic research has shown that families stewarded by people who have made money raise children who are far more likely tothrive financially. Unfortunately, Mr. Carroll was born into an Oakland family more akin to a ‘Breaking Bad’ episode.
His single mother and grandmothersufferedaddictions to crack. Curtis received littleguidancefrom his elders. Hewiggledhis way out of homework rendering himself illiterate.
The only thing he learned was that hehated school. Curtis was eventually forced onto the streets with his brother at an early age —homeless.
Agangtook him in. Then a robbery ended inmurder.
Curtis Carroll has lived in jail for two decades since ageseventeen. He has thirty-four years left on hissentence. The light at the end of his tunnel is two hundred dollars and a hard shove out of theprison gates.
“Do You Play Stocks?”
… afellowinmate asked one day. Curtis wasbaffled. He listenedintentlyas the man explained “This is where white people keep their money.” The conversation ignited Mr. Carroll’sdefinite major purposeof succeeding in equity investments.
To do so required theabilityto read.
He focused hisburning desireon deciphering popular t-shirts and wrappers of candy he ate.
As hisliteracygrew he consumed the financial media. The world ofWall Streetcame to absorb the attention of every fiber of his being. Curtis studied the market every day untilcollapsefrom exhaustion.
He recorded andtrackedhis stock picks on paper in an envelope stuck to his cell wall.
The San Quentinnicknameof Curtis Carroll quickly became “Wall Street.” Hisfollowinghas grown.
Every Thursday night, according to National Public Radio (NPR), about a hundred inmates meet to hear hispurely positive messagethat even though people are in prison that they are on the same ground as Warren Buffet.Inmatesworking with parents, siblings and spouses on the outside can invest in the same stock Buffet buys and sells.  They can't buy as many shares, but they can buysharesin the same firms.
Warren Buffet’s Top 10 Stock Investing Rules
The San Quentin Freeman Capital financial literacy inmate group of Curtis “Wall Street” Carroll teaches wisdom straight from the lips of theOracle of Omaha…
1.Save and Persist.Only a burning desire directed persistently at the definite major purpose of succeeding in stocks can carry you through.
2.Live Lavishly Frugal.Focus your attention on each household expense to determine the best use of your funds. When you spend money on anything from a car to household furniture determine the best balance between cost and long-term utility.
3.Minimize Risk.Develop as many alternative scenarios that can play out after you invest your money.
4.Think First.You always have the most choices before you lock up your savings. Think your defensive tactics through before you invest.
5.Cut Losses.Cut your losers, ride your winners. Plan your maximum allowable loss beforehand.
6.Seek High Potential. Invest in companies with proven management at the helm. Follow managers you would be delighted to have in your family.
7.Limit Debt.Don’t buy stocks wallowing in other-peoples-money (OPM). Cash out credit cards each month.
8.Cultivate Fearlessness.Buffett says that he can tell who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out. Buy great stocks on the cheap just after a major market crash.  Act when other investors tremble.
9.Compound Your Gains.Reinvesting your profits is the best way to really get your money working for you.
10.Become Steady As a Rock.An iconoclastic think-for-yourself mentality is the only road to investment success. Shun chit-chat regarding stocks tips, rumors and investment newsletter recommendations that poison your independent thinking and action.
Warren Buffett doesn’t measure success in terms of alavish lifestyle. He measures success by the degree to which hesqueezesevery drop of potential profit out of the investment portfolio he stewards.
He follows his owninternal score-card. An ever frugal Buffett shunsglossy external displays(score-cards) of wealth commonly projected by Wall Street Fortune 500 CEOs.
Buffett'sfrugalityrings true throughout the history of financial greatness.
Think and Grow Rich
At the turn of the last century the richest man in the world commissioned a young man with the unlikely name ofNapoleonto document a universal philosophy of wealth. After decades ofunpaidtoil ‘Think and Grow Rich’ became an enduring best-seller that has inspired millions.
Case in point is anotherdestitutelad, not unlike Mr. Carroll, who decided to shun poverty after reading a discarded copy of Think and Grow Rich.
W. Clement Stone had tired of throwing rocks atstokerstending steam locomotive coal tenders out of horror of the possible injury of others. He had been doing what he had to do to survive. This action helped his family heat their home in otherwise lethally cold northern winters with lumps of coalboiler-menthrew back.
CEO Stone rose togreat wealthat the top of the insurance industry teaching others to “Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity.”
Curtis Carroll follows the same path as W. Clement Stone and Warren Buffett helping inmates guide family members on the outside towise investment decisions. Mr. Carroll teaches in atonement of past destruction with hope that his paroled friends fall into thelovingarms of wealthy families rather than badass gang-bangers.
""I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.""- Warren Buffett

'This is by far the best course on investing on Udemy'  -Hamid Mahmood
'What I have watched, this material is superb. No matter if you are a newbie which can grab this information for better use and more mature investor. The tips on fees and historical statistics pay the course.'-Diana Chan (5/5 Stars)
'Great comprehensive course for the basics of passive investing, definitely covers quite a bit! Helped me massively.. I have already opened an account and started investing.. Will look to now further my studies in this field. Thanks Jari'-Avinash Verma(5/5 Stars)
-----------------------------
How would you like to have your ownpassively managedstock portfolio, that takes a day to set up,constantly works for you,grows your moneyand costs only 10 hoursa yearto manage?
I know it may sound too good to be true, because the method of investing that most people attempt is to find a needle in a haystack. They try to find that one company that they think will outperform the market and they do so by spending weeks analyzing different companies before making a decision. The painful truth is:
For the majority of investors this turns out to be the wrong decision and they end up losing.
I do things differently..
I putt the odds of winning in my favor as I approach my finances by this creed:
""Invest your time actively and your money passively. It's the best kept secret in the world."" -Michael LeBoeuf, Ph.D., author of The Millionaire In You
That's solid advice. And more and more people are heeding this advice because passive index investing has gained MASSIVE popularity over the past half a decade.
Why is this?
It's very simply because of money and time.
Passive investing earns more money.
Passive investing costs almost ZERO time.
More and more investors are waking up to the fact that, for years and years now, passively managed funds have outperformed active investors across the board.
Even the most popular ACTIVE investor in the world,Warren Buffett,encourages investors to switch to a passive way of investing their money.
He said:''most investors would be better off investing their money in a low-cost index fund''.
And that's because he knows that most people aren't him.
Most people just don't have the time and skill to perfect the art of value investing like Warren Buffett has..
And a passive investing strategy provides a nearly perfect answer. It requires a lot less effort and time than an active strategy and earns much more money in the end. Total win-win.
With that being said, you will need to take certain specific steps in order to set up the best possible portfolio for your personal situation. And those steps are perfectly laid out in this course.
AFTER COMPLETING THE COURSE YOU WILL:
Have your ownautomated, highly profitable money-making machine (stock portfolio)that will earn you money 24/7
Have the ability to earn money while yousleep. Literally.
Radiate financialconfidence
Have the ability to pass on your knowledge to your children or other people YOU want to see financially well off
Have the ability to construct Passive Portfolios for those you want to grant some financial security in the future
and much, much more.

""The evidence is clear that the vast majority of individual investors would improve their outcomes if they adopted the passive strategy.""- Larry Swedroe, author of Think, Act, and Invest Like Warren Buffett
The Benefits of Passive Investing :
High Returns :Did you know that the average individual earns only 2.9% per year? That’s ridiculously low. Passive investing earns 3X that amount.
Time Efficient :You don’t need to put in a lot of time. Spending only a couple of hoursper yearis enough.
Automation :Passive investing = automated investing. You can basically earn money while you sleep (or do something more productive, for that matter)
Low Costs :The costs of passive investing are much lower compared to other strategies. This will literally save you thousands of dollars in the end.
Accessibility :You can already start investing with a hundred dollars, you don’t have to put in a lot of time and you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to start. It's and everyman's strategy.
“Most investors beat themselves by engaging in mistaken stock market strategies rather than accepting the passive buy-and- hold indexing approach (..). The way most investors behave, the stock market becomes a loser’s game.” -Burton Malkiel, author of A Random Walk Down Wall Street

474150,Technical Analysis tools for Stocks and Options trading,"Technical analysis has become extensive in recent years. Technical analysis works 60 to 70% of the time, and this is because fundamental events (earnings reports, lawsuits, mergers or acquisitions and many more events) always trump any technical pattern. However, in the absence of fundamental events, which is 60% to 70% of the time, technical analysis works because traders don't have any other information to go by.
There are several categories of technical analysis - Price indicators, Support and Resistance levels, Momentum indicators, Volume indicators, Oscillators and Statistical price movement indicators. This is again an area where the KISS rule applies - Keep It Simple S-----. We cut through all the noise and show you some of the key indicators you should study and that's all you really need to make informed entry and exit decisions. Technical analysis is a self-fulfilling prophecy and gives deep insight into crowd behavior. The more people follow Technical analysis patterns, the more they are likely to take action in some sort of co-ordinated manner.
Hope you enjoy this comprehensive suite of 10 very important Technical analysis tools. You will undoubtedly prefer some over the others, and that's fine. The key is to use the correct type of indicator for the specific situation you're trying to analyze.
The analysis and practical application of these Technical analysis tools are demonstrated on a Live trading platform with several examples. In that regard, this is a very practical guide to understanding Technical analysis tools.

387348,Financial Statement Fundamentals for Small Biz & Investors,"
Be the businessperson & investor you have always wanted to be...
With Financial Statement Fundamentals you will turn your accounting 'records' into value-creating, actionable information allowing increased profits, better cash flow & a higher net worth.
You will be given a clearly structured walkthrough of the three main financial statements. These documents, provided by your accountant or accounting software, will no longer appear to be written in an abstract, foreign language.
After the course you will be able to read and navigate through the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement. And with this knowledge you will have an insight into your business or investments that you have never had the opportunity to see …and from then on, will never want to go without!
Understand the Financial Statements with this Comprehensive Course and Prosper in Business & Investing from Using Financial Data
With this deep-dive course, you will:
When you take this course, understand the financial statements and start using them, you will never view your business and investments the same again.
For thousands of years there has been some form of accounting record keeping for reporting purposes. While the process has moved from stone carvings to the digital era, financial statements for financial reporting purposes continue to offer a high-level overview of the activities of a business or organisation.
Being able to view beyond the numbers of financial statements and tell the story of a business is a unique skill held by accountants and financial analysts. It enables them to advise businesses and investors on the best course of action to improve the returns on their client's capital. And while this course will not in itself be able to make you a professional advisor (although it can start you on that journey), it will allow you to view any business or any investment and assess its performance or position based on the three financial statements.
The course has been developed for small business owners and stock market investors who, while skilled in their own field, have no direct accounting or financial education or training.
The course is structured as follows:
It begins with an introductory section that describes the benefits and content of the complete course (including bonus resources) as well as a brief introduction to the financial statements and why they are unique and useful.
You then move on to learn some fundamental accounting theory. This is considered important (and thus included in the course) because it will help you understand what is going on 'under the hood' of the financial reports which you will later cover.
From here you will begin your journey through the financial statements. The income statement comes first, followed by the balance sheet and finally the cash flow statement. To keep it clear and straightforward the structure of each statement's section is quite similar so you can see the three statements in contrast to each other.
With your new grounding in the statements, you then study how they all can and do link with each other, as well as how you can find more information and detail in the 'notes' to the financial statements.
To assist your learning experience as greatly as possible and achieve the learning outcomes (as opposed to just watching videos) each section includes a revision quiz and many sections include 'Action Stations' where you are guided on how to begin to put theory into practice.
Last but not least, you will find many free, attached bonus resources.Not only will you have example basic financial statements to study along the way, you will receive three free PDF eBooks that are normally only available for sale. These eBooks cover accounting foundations, income statement basics and balance sheet basics and provide more written detail, or at least another delivery method, in your accounting knowledge journey.

Your Peer TraderChandra
SEGMENT ONE : CHARTSTo be a successful trader, you need to know to read Charts. I go over the important chart patterns that I use on a regular basis. The chart patterns go beyond the regular charts and is simple to follow and at the same time very powerful. This is a MUST WATCH segment , whether you trade stocks or options or futures.
SEGMENT TWO: MANAGE HOW TO HANDLE RISKI constantly get emails about how their good streak of profits ended with some nasty losses. This segment addresses this very important aspect of trading - Managing risks. My training does not go into the ""feel good"" factor of creating some stop losses. It is objective measure of how long or short you are ; what will happen during a market reversal, how much money are you going to lose etc.  Very Powerful information that most traders do not know .
SEGMENT THREE: HANDLING THE STRESSA trade happens between the ears. To be a successful trader, you need to win the battle of your mind. I go through the lessons explaining what I do to keep a balanced mindset.  Believe me, this is the most difficult task among all, and differentiates me from 99 % of the traders.SEGMENT FOUR : OPTION STRATEGIESIt is exclusively focused on Options, different option strategies with some simple examples. Very important for traders who have basic idea of options.SEGMENT FIVEI have some recommendations on some good , newsletters etc.
SEGMENT SIX: LESSONS FROM SALVAGING TRADES FROM LOSSESEven the best trader is going to see trades go against them; that is the reality. I have spent a whopping seventeen chapters with real life examples of trade that went against me and how I salvaged to scrap the trade for a profit.  As an example, I was short Adobe when the sucker gapped up eighteen dollars . Watch how I salvaged the trade ; and of course my favorite is Goldman Sachs that whipsawed me to a potential big loss to a tiny profit.
Even mature traders will find this segment very useful and can use it as a blueprint for handling trades that go against them.
SEGMENT SEVEN: MAKE WINNING A HABITLosing trades follow several path ; But winning trades usually have a clear pattern . They work in your favor early on. I have several examples of real trades that were comfortable winners. Looking back at what was the reasoning and chart pattern at entry. Fits well with segment Six of the training program.SEGMENT EIGHTThe mirror image of Winners - Losers.  Very important to learn from losers as well

306360,How to Read Financial Statements:  Build Financial Literacy.,"""The number one problem in today's generation and economy is the lack of financial literacy"" - Alan Greenspan,  Chairman of the U. S. Federal Reserve  1987 to 2006
If you are in business, you need to speak the language.  No matter if you’re in sales, marketing, manufacturing, purchasing, accounting, or finance, you need to speak the language of business.  Perhaps you own a small business or are an entrepreneur starting a business… or you need a better job and are thinking about going to business school… or you provide legal and consulting services to businesses.  You’ll be more credible, make better decisions, and enjoy more success if you speak the language of business.
The Importance of Financial Statements in Today’s World
The language of business is encapsulated in financial statements.  Financial statements provide a scorecard for how a business is doing.  Over a series of years, it provides a map of the business’s performance.  Managers judge the success of their business with financial statements.  Investors make intelligent investing decisions with financial statements.  In addition, people in the business world are being held more accountable for their financial statement practices since Enron and WorldCom.  They need to know what goes into financial statements.
Learn to Read Financial Statements, Not Prepare Them.
Just as you don’t need to understand how to make a car in order to drive one,you don’t have to understand bookkeeping to read financial statements. I've prepared a course that eliminates the bookkeeping drudgery and concentrates on the end product of accounting, how to read financial statements, not how to prepare them.
Like climbing a spiral staircase, I will teach you how to read three real company’s financial statements (Whole Foods, Sherwin Williams, and Facebook), starting with the simple and progressing to the complex, interspersing the statements with key accounting terms and concepts to help you build expertise.
Sounds good? Here is exactly what we will cover:
The course contains 20 three-to-eight-minute-videos each followed by a multiple-choice quiz. A case is provided for Facebook.
The course will take 100 minutes to view the videos and another 45 minutes to take the quizzes and do the Facebook case.

Examine the course image more closely. Notice how there are many different emotions?
How you feel about money is a clue regarding your current mindset.
Your mindset is effecting your results ... for better or worse.
This course covers:
1) how (I believe) an abundant mindsetlooks and feels. I'm giving you a pictorial representation of mindset (mindset is normally invisible) that's easy to work with, understand, and use to foster your mental changes.
2) how to craft your own abundance mindset.
3) what to do, and how to tell, when you don't know if you're mindset is changing.
PLEASE LOOK OVER THE COURSE OBJECTIVES FOR MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT WHAT THIS COURSE COVERS.
The information in this course is practical and applicable, immediately. I'm giving you the structure for ourfamilymoney mindset— which contains the same components, the same structure, that I've discovered to be among many wealthy individuals.
I explain the ""wealth money mindset"" in a simple way so you can see HOW it takes shape just by living a normal, everyday life. I teach you how an abundant mindset looks and FEELS.

Risk Disclosure:
Futures and forex trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing ones’ financial security or life style. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
Hypothetical Performance Disclaimer.
Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. no representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown; in fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk of actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all which can adversely affect trading results.

We are sharing our hot and most profitable strategy for you to learn. It continues to generate returns in 2018.
This course was offered for $249.00 last year, but due to the recent Udemy policy, it has been lowered to $29.  It is a great deal for everyone to learn.  This is a ridiculous offer for a strategy that can generate 300 X initial education investment in a year.
Please take advantage today as we can take down this course anytime from Udemy.
The recent returns on this strategy:
2018: 112% up to Q2
2017: 175% based on $5,000 futures margin.
2016: Up to 12/31/2016: 156% based on $5,000 futures margin.
2015:   Up to 12/31/2015:  212% based on $5,000 futures margin.
2014: 327% based on $5,000 futures margin.
This result is achieved with minimum unit and position size. Performance can be multiplied easily using bigger size.  The strategy is scalable as account equity grows.
This course is intended to all-level of traders and investors.  Explained with easy-to-understand lectures and documentation.  Even if you never learn how to trade before, this course will be clear, concise and simple enough to learn for you.
Can achieve much larger return with compounded return and position sizing. (Will teach in the course how to do so).
Trade less but high win percentage. Typically 1 to 4 trades a week. No need to watch the market all day. This is great for busy people. You can place alerts, buy/sell orders and leave them.
Well-defined stops and targets. We always limit our loss and manage risk properly.
Less trading means less commission fees you paid and prevent overtrading, which is the top issue with retail and regular traders.
Strategy trades Emini S&P500 futures or S&P500 ETF that can be traded like regular stocks. It can be applied to other index ETFs, as well.
Easy to learn in less than an hour and can start applying the strategy in live market.
Course is priced low as an introduction compared to $499 price at our website. Less than 50% of typical winning trade. It may go up as demands get larger.  We can also pull this course anytime to limit the exposure of this proprietary system.
The course is designed from the scratch with beginners in mind.  Here is what you will get:
Learn the same Psychology of Trading and Risk Management training that are taught to traders at top investment banks. This lecture itself could be worth the entire admission price.
Everything you need to know about futures and ETF (Exchange Traded Funds)
How to trade futures and ETFs. They can be traded with normal brokerage accounts. (Extra: how to choose the right brokers for the purpose)
Learn how to use the stock chart for our strategy.
The EXACT step-by-step instructions how to apply the proprietary strategy in the market.  We willliterally hand-holdyou in the course what to do.
No ambiguity and no confusion.
No information overload. We teach the most important parts of trading the markets that we use regularly as senior traders in investment banks.
The strategy is so simple that a 12-year-old can trade it. We apologize for the analogy, but it is true.   	                                            Why simple is good?  After trading professionally for many years, we came to conclusion that simple strategies are the best in performance. Using multiple indicators, multiple moving averages, fundamental data, and other signals is typically a curve-fitting strategy and mostly will not work well in real-time trading in live markets.
Depending on your knowledge levels, the course can be completed quickly.  However, we suggest to repeat and repeat again until you understand. Practice on the simulation or live market is recommended and should be done as often as possible.
If you are one of the traders, market participants, or enthusiasts as follows, then you will greatly benefit from the course:
Has studied many trading books, seminars, or hours worth of courses and is still not sure how to trade the markets. This strategy is a concrete 1-2-3 strategy that will help you make money right away.
Has attempted to trade, but inconsistent.  This strategy will give you a consistent result and make you a better trader.
Frequently blew out accounts.  This course will help you how to manage risks.
Beginners who never traded or traded a bit before and want to learn a good method to trade.  This course can help you to start and make money right away.
Hopefully, this course and strategy can help the community to trade better and beat the markets.  Please take the course and help yourself to be a better trader.

602032,Ultimate Stock Market Investing: Learn How to Value Stocks,"Becoming a great stock investor and earningsuperior investment returnsis much simpler than you probably think. Itdoes notinvolve simply handing your money over to a professional (this costs you way too much money—without the results). Itdoes notinvolve complicated formulas and “systems” that work for a year or two before losing you money. Instead, it takes using the same type of approach that the greatest and most successful investors before you have been doing for the last century. This course shows you the process required and the skills needed in order to realize enhanced investment returns for the long-term.
Master the Skill ofAccurately Valuing Stocks, Enabling You to Earn Annualized Investment Returnsin Excessof 12%
A Powerful Skill to Possess in an Unpredictable Financial World
Today’s financial world is full of unknowns. How much do you need to retire? Where should you put your money? How secure are your investments? Having the capability to confidently answer those questions for you and your family, along with the peace of mind of financial security, is an extremely valuable asset.
This confidence and peace of mind comes from using an investment strategy that has stood the test of time in generating enhanced returns. One that has been practiced, developed, and fine-tuned by investment experts with a combined 40+ years of experience. Mastering the skill of accurately valuing stocks and earning returns above the average allows you to build your investment accounts to values you previously only dreamed of; and it allows you to withdraw a greater amount of income throughout your retirement years.
Contents and Overview
This complete course is jam-packed with over 37 lectures of educational content. We’ll begin with an explanation of the ultimate investment strategy, and how we have developed it to generate massive returns for those who properly use it. We’ll then go on to explain why following the traditional financial path, earning the average return, and paying the average fee—could be costing you up to 78% of your investment account value!
You will see the true impact of what 12%+ returns can do for not only your investment and retirement accounts, but also for your lifestyle and income during retirement. By the end of this lecture, we hope you will realize that this strategy will greatly benefit you, whether you are still in your working years or currently in your retirement years.
The course will continue with a simple explanation of the first principle of successful investing, by focusing on a real-life example of one of the most basic businesses imaginable. We’ll then continue with a quick explanation of the power of compound interest, as well as the different investment choices you have when deciding where and how to allocate your hard-earned money. We’ll wrap up the second section with a thorough education on the #1 determinant of future returns, as well as scenarios which are best for buying and selling stocks.
In section three, you’ll discover the second principle to successful investing, and the path we followed to arrive at the ultimate investment strategy you are learning. You’ll then see the importance of combining the two principles, and how only using one and not the other could potentially lead to losing money. This is something you will want to avoid!
In the next section, you will learn why investing in stocks is the same as investing in businesses, and how you can use that knowledge to your advantage. We’ll continue with our basic company from section two, and see how going public affects companies, and your potential involvement with them as an investor. In this lecture, you will see which information is required for you to fully and accurately place a value on public stocks.
The course will continue with a detailed account of how much stock prices typically move in a given year (probably more than you think). You will then seewhythese stock prices move, and what influences the high and low prices. After that, you will learn about the best business partner in the world, and how you can fully, legally and ethically work with, and take advantage of him to make a consistent profit. We will also debunk one of the more commonly referred to investment theories, and prove why the ultimate investment strategy is a much better alternative.
In section five, you will learn all about the three most important words of investing—and how you could get nearly everything else wrong—and still make money! We’ll go on to define the face value, as well as each of the components you will need to place a face value on any stock you choose. After a detailed walkthrough, you will be armed with the skill to place a value on any stock in the market. You will know whether you are overpaying, or purchasing a stock on sale.
We will cap off section five illustrating the difference between a $15 stock and a $30 stock—showing why stock price per share, on its’ own, is insignificant. You will see that it involves other information to differentiate between a $30 stock, and a $15 stock.
In the final section, we will explain how to apply the second principle, and you will have the skill to spot only those companies which pass the test under the second principle of successful investing. We will detail what the one final check is, and an important question to ask yourself, before making the purchase of any stock. After this final check, we will detail the four conditions under which you might want to sell any of your stock holdings. After completing this lecture, you will have the capability to highlight which stocks you want to buy, place a value on them, buy them when they are on sale, and know when you might need to sell them.
Before saying goodbye, we will present you with our closing thoughts, as well as a step-by-step game plan for getting started on your first purchase.
Complete with examples, stock charts, full explanations, and different scenarios, this course will enable investors of all skill levels to work alongside your instructors every step of the way, by participating in the class discussion boards and tapping into our knowledge and experience with the markets.",All Levels,Business Finance,https://www.udemy.com/stock-investing/,True

Welcome to our Stock Trading: Learn How to Swing Trade Stocks and Stock Options course. This course is designed for both new and intermediate level traders who are looking to expand their knowledge and understanding of the stock market.
As an experienced trader, I have had the opportunity to make and lose thousands of dollars playing the stock market. However, I am now ready to share my knowledge and experiences with you in order to help you avoid the same mistakes and capitalize on the same opportunities that I have. In this course, you will not only learn the theory of trading, but also watch and learn from my real-life examples of how I risk big money and see the actual results from my years of active trading, including my biggest success of winning and losing thousands of dollars. Minimize losing money by learning from my mistakes.
This course includes hours of extra content that has recently been updated and is normally priced at $199. However, for a limited time, we are offering it on sale. This is a great opportunity for you to learn from a professional trader and master the stock market.
Throughout this course, you will learn essential concepts and strategies such as how to create a paper money account, where to play with paper money, how to research stocks and do analysis, and how to swing trade. We highly recommend mastering these concepts with a paper money account before using real money. Additionally, if you already know the basics of options trading, you can skip the newbie section and jump right into the more intermediate concepts.
This course will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the stock market, and give you the tools you need to put the odds in your favor. However, it is important to note that this is a professional level of trading, and not everyone is suited for it. In fact, 95% of all traders who attempt it have been known to lose everything. Despite this, the 5% who do make it can make a living doing just that.
It is important to note that we cannot promise you amazing returns and anyone who claims to do so is lying. The stock market is unpredictable and no one knows what the future holds.

Knowledge of management accounting helps in designing the most appropriate internal financial information systems. The Management Accounting course explains how you can analyse financial statements to make the right decisions in the day-to-day activities in an organisation, which in turn will help add value to the organisation.
With the help of financial data, managers make decisions regarding day-to-day activities in the organisation. Management accounting helps in taking the right decisions. It is concerned with providing information to managers, that is, people in an organisation who direct and control its operation. Managerial accounting is manager-oriented and provides the essential data with which the organisations are actually run.Management accounting is much broader than financial accounting because it includes aspects of managerial economics, industrial engineering, and management science. However, management accounting and financial accounting are part of the total accounting information system. The content of management accounting system is driven by the needs of the financial accounting system. A firm’s profitability is of interest to investors but managers need to know the profitability of individual products. The accounting system should be designed to provide total profits and profits for individual products. Hence, accounting system should be able to supply different information for different purposes.Join us on this exciting journey as we learn about Management Accounting and how to apply it in organisations.

44319,Master Calendar Spreads with this live trade on Gold (GLD),"MASTER CALENDAR SPREADS
Calendars Spreads are popular trades and come under the category of Time spreads. In a Calendar spread, we sell the front month Option series and buy the back month Option. The Calendar is generally constructed at the money, however, you can create bullish or bearish variations. It starts out as a delta neutral but can quickly move into a biased position. The Calendar is also one of the few strategies that is a Theta positive and a Vega positive trade. Because it is Vega positive, your Calendar will do better if Volatility increases after you put the trade on. The primary method of profit in Calendar Spread Strategy is to take advantage of a higher level of time decay in the front month. We put a Calendar trade on the GLD, and this quickly turns into a Double Calendar when price moves too much in one direction. In fact, this trade is an absolute roller-coaster and you will learn a very valuable lesson - Don't give up on your losers. If you simply close your losers and move on to the next trade, you will make the same mistakes and lose again. Fight your losers and turn them back into a break-even and you would have never felt better with a trade.

Risk Disclosure:
Futures and forex trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing ones’ financial security or life style. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
Hypothetical Performance Disclaimer.
Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. no representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown; in fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk of actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all which can adversely affect trading results.

971110,The Truths about (in)secure Retirement,"UPDATED: Sept 2020
Get rid of that haunting fear about your early retirement
Avoid getting financially stressed & miserable in your retirement years when you retire early
Let’s face it, nobody is looking for a ‘budget’ retirement.
Modern day retirement is synonymous with experiencing some of the best things in life, such as dining out at Michelin stars restaurants, indulgent golfing and luxurious vacations.
The aching question in your mind now is this:
I am ready to live the retirement live I've always dreamt of, but I am also feeling terrified that I will soon run out of money before running out of life
It *may not happen, but it is unthinkable if it turns out your longevity genes are better than you think. You are not taking any chances.
Sometimes, you aren’t really sure if you want to know, it is like having a nagging pain at the back of your head but you keep on avoiding a doctor’s appointment, because finding out the truth can be too depressing.
On the other hand, you absolutely don't want to live like a miser in retirement after years of toiling at your career.
This IS the ultimate reward you have been looking for in your life.
And YES, you absolutely deserved your dream retirement after years of blood and sweat and tears.
This is what makes life worth living.
But right now, you are in a dilemma.
WHICH OF THESE 17 'RETIREMENT PEACE KILLERS' ARE LINGERING IN YOUR MIND NOW THAT PREVENTS YOU FROM RETIRING (EARLY) WITH PEACE OF MIND?
Since 2002, I had been advising a multitude of clients on managing retirement finances. But there is a deeper layer to that than just money. I then began the years-long process of examining  inner psychology to find why people are not retiring with the peace of mind they deserve, despite all the money & free information available.
I discovered a concept I call “Retirement Peace Killers,” imagination of scenarios that could likely materialize with one major mistake in managing your retirement nest egg. Most of the time, it is invisible to even the closest people in your lives because you never really expressed it explicitly.
Take a hard look to see which of these 17 most pernicious Retirement Peace Killers apply to you
Procrastinating at the price tag of everything you want to buy, fearing overspending, even if you are shopping at discount stores.
Never fail to clip coupons and discount vouchers on everything. A penny saved is a penny earned.
Deeply disturbed by the prospect of being at the financial mercy of your relatives or children.
Let your elderly parents down because you are unable to subsidize their daily living costs.
Feeling helpless for not being able to fund your children education to the kind of university courses that will fully maximize their potential.
Feeling frustrated for not being able to assist adult children in buying their first home or preparing for wedding.
Worried that it will ‘exceed’ your monthly budget if you offer to pick up the tab for a family dinner or drinking session with your buddies.
Feeling distressed as you force yourself to stop eating out at your favorite fine dining establishment after the new management increased the prices of everything in the menu.
Feeling agonized that you need to substitute the imported household goods you are using with generic brands because currency depreciation makes everything expensive.
Heart skip a few beats every time any political or economic turbulence shave off 10% from your portfolio overnight before you had the chance to even login to your investment account.
Panic selling more times than you can remember when your retirement portfolio drops more than 4%, cutting loss before it plummet further, only to see it recovers in a week.
Feeling paranoia to read the business section on the newspaper, and deliberately avoid from listening or watching any economic news.
Chronically losing sleep over your retirement sustenance, wondering if you will have enough in the next 5 to 10 years to pay the bills.
Had a harrowing experience in your recent visits to the hospital that your hypertension condition will shave a big chunk off your retirement nest egg.
Desperately researching places like Nicaragua, Panama, Malaysia and Thailand as your second home in retirement to save costs, moving away from the community you are so familiar with
Not able to fulfill bucket list of owning a boat to travel the world.
Not able to fulfill bucket list of owning a boat to travel the world.
That's what gonna happen if you don't have sufficient confidence that your accumulated retirement nest egg can sustain you throughout your retirement years.
We’ve all desired about retiring early but don’t want to live below the poverty line in the later years of retirement.
The knee-jerk response is of course to scour the Internet for a miracle solution, hoping that people who have 'been there, done that' will tell you exactly what to do and what NOT to do.
But know this, everyone is unique. You could take bits and pieces of information here and there, and haphazardly patch them together as your retirement plan.
So what will you get?
A Frankenstein monster for your retirement which is neither living nor dead. It will come back to bite you later.
The other knee jerk response is to keep on working, or thinking of cutting your retirement short and take up a contractual/short term positions. Retirement is far from what you envision.
You start to lose hope.
More importantly, the very fact of your anxiety over the 17 Retirement Peace Killers will throw you into a destructive cycle, called the Wheel of Negativity. I've seen so much in the many clients I consult on, and believe me, you don't want to ride in this wheel. It deters you from truly enjoying your retirement years.
**********
Yes, you can absolutely avoid all these Retirement Peace Killers and negativity
By following a system which provides consistent passive income stream, growing with inflation and large unaffected by recession
I know because I've been advising my clients on retirement using this system for the past 4+ years
Prior to 2012, I struggled in my practice to advise clients on the kind of retirement portfolio with 95% confidence level to sustain their retirement years. I even put my own money on the line. You know that feeling of seeing your nest egg shrink due to factors beyond your control? I feel the same for my clients.
Although my clients didn't blame me for failing to meet the targeted annual returns due to various systemic factors, I knew I was letting them down.  It was one of the most frustrating, draining times of my life.
In fact, looking back, I almost every financial instruments under the sun: I wasted time learning about forex & commodity tradings, options, CFDs and global macro strategies.  I got overwhelmed by all the advice out there.
But I was learning in leaps and bounds. What are the fluff that didn't work specifically for retirement. Why people are not enjoying retirement they way they should. I went deeper into the psychology of retirement.
In 2012, I created a 2 pronged system. The first prong to resolve this ever fluctuating sustainable income for retirement, and the second prong - mindset.
I tested it with my existing retirement clients. And monitor the results. Fast forward to now, suffice to say that the results blew my mind. Itgave them a peace of mind and elevated their quality of retirement life.
Best of all...
You don't need to undertake high investment risks
You don't need to use leverage
You can use it regardless of any country you live in
You don't need to an expert in finance to follow the system
Let me show you what I discovered along the way.
But first, I want to ask you an honest question.
If a successful retirement is as simple as  buying or investing into any of the many retirement products in the market, why are you still deeply worried about your retirement sustainability?
BRUTAL TRUTH: SUCCESSFUL RETIREMENT IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST INVESTING & INFORMATION
There are tons of free retirement articles online.
There is no shortage of financial products specifically catered for retirement.
Andyet, people are still feeling insecure about their own retirement.
If information and products mattered, almost nobody would be worried about their financial security in retirement.
The truth is, there's something that matters at least as much as the information.
And that missing piece is asystem that integrates the financial and psychology aspect of retirement.
**********
What Motivates me to create this system to help you?
Because years in the financial services industry, I became disenchanted with many financial service providers approaches in educating the man on the street on retirement.
This happens everywhere around the world - whether you are in US, Canada, South Africa, Europe, Asia or Australia
As I started growing my business, I started to see through the industry's shortcomings.
What I discovered was that most of the experts were selling 2 things: PRODUCTS & PROMISES. They were happy to sell you a product and wash their hands clean, because they didn't care about your retirement success — they just cared about the sale and their sales quota.
I never wanted to run a business like that. So I spent years crafting my a sustainable retirement system for my clients. It is about impact. I added things that nobody in the industry offers.
Because the brutal truth is that most retirement advice is narrow, simplistic, or downright deceptive.
This is the problem with piecemeal advice, tactics or products: They give you one piece, but never the entire SYSTEM.
In case you are thinking...
Is it just about investing bonds or ETFs?
Nope it isn't.
In the initial years when I started advising clients on retirement - like most advisers, I followed the conventional post-retirement investing mantras - invest in high grade bonds.  However, in the recent years, bonds yields fail to provide sufficient income for retirement, eaten alive by inflation. Worse, it is prone to defaults which means you aren’t getting your capital back when the bond reaches maturity..
I also advised clients to invest in index funds that are often touted for it cost effectiveness. However, then we concurred the returns are nothing to shout about.
My system of advising clients in retirement involves enjoying the freedom, being proactive in anticipating next year's income without letting the external factors beyond control affect them
It involves more work up front, but...
Retirees who take this route don't spend much time worrying about what they can't control, and avoiding all the negative emotions caused by it
**********
In case you are thinking...I don't see myself retiring soon, so this is irrelevant to me
Sometimes retiring early becomes the only involuntary option.
WHY?
Technology is transforming the labor market, eliminating millions of conventional jobs even as it creates new opportunities. Which sides are you currently on?
Office politics, extensive travelling, no prospect for advancement, management shake-up ...you want to pursue something on your own terms and time using the skills you possessed but you will take a paycut. How will it jeopardize your retirement plans?
Your career is taking its toll on your health and/or family. The longer you endure this, the shorter your lifespan will be. Money doesn't mean anything if you don't live long enough to enjoy it
Company offer early retirement package (aka voluntary separation scheme) as part of cost-cutting exercise- should you take it and risk being out of job for indefinite time because there is no employable prospect at your age and salary range?
You get a financial windfall (shareholder buyout, cashing out etc) - You wonder if you should just sit on it generating risk-free guaranteed return cash deposit rate or you need to invest it more aggresively?
Your company or industry is going downhill - if you got retrenched now, do you have enough to last until twilight years?
Fear of missing out (FOMO) - with a few more short productive years left in your high-flying career, you are desperate to make the very best use of your earning power to build a [insert your number here] retirement nest egg?

In case you are thinking...I already have a retirement plan, why should I care?
Many of the assumptions on which those plans were based –including sustained low inflation and an expectation for continued globalization – have been upended.
Brexit is reshaping Europe
Upheaval in the Middle East is having global consequences
The U.S. is anticipating reflation, rising rates, and renewed growth
President Trump’s fiscal, tax and trade policies will further impact the economic landscape.
What may have worked well for you so far mightcome to an end.
**********
This is probably the most comprehensive guide and checklist of ideas/ways/strategies on what you need to do to, in anticipation of retirement.
It does not overwhelm you from the start as it gradually builds up the fundamentals of retirement planning/calculation. Yet, in the final section, the course provides you with the most detailed/advanced/complete spreadsheet/worksheet containing various retirement formulas - helping you to visualize/simulate things like the year-by-year effect of withdrawal, inflation, etc.
If you need a quick/fast result now to know whether you have enough to retire immediately, skip to the Advanced section right away. Otherwise, it is recommended that you follow the course intended sequence.
This course is also especially useful if you are in late in retirement planning, or retirees currently in your post-retirement stage - to maximize your means & meaning right now.
=============================================================================
A GOOD RETIREMENT LIFE IS NOT JUST ABOUT HOW LARGE IS YOUR RETIREMENT NEST EGG AT THE ONSET OF RETIREMENT. OR HOW LONG IT CAN LAST.
Most people wrongly think it has everything to do with personal wealth or material possessions.
Living the good retirement life can mean different things to different people. It depends on what really matters to you - your values, priorities or goals in life.
If I can summarize it in one word - it isbalance.
Balance between the means and meanings along the retirement journey.
One cannot exist without the other. While it is hard to have meanings without having the means, having sufficient means alone won't guarantee meanings.
Therefore, it is always a balancing act. The name of the game isn't just about rest and sleep until you finally wither away and pass on.
In fact, during your retirement journey, the things and people you value may change over time. There are also market factors will definitely affect your retirement nest egg.
Dynamic situations require dynamic solutions which you need to adjust over time.
This course teaches you how.
==============================================================
You might think - ""I can learn all of this elsewhere, why should I learn from you?""
No, you can't. Go google about the detailed explanations of Scenario Modelling Analysis and try to find someone that not only how to implement but also GIVES you examples on its use.
=============================================================
""Can you make me rich by taking your course?""
No way! Not just from taking the course. Anyone who promises you that is selling snake oil.
What I can guarantee is that you will leave with some perspectives how to manage your retirement nest egg better in today's volatile market.
=============================================================
Tell me again why I should take your course?
If you've read this far down, you already know why. You've always wanted to. So why haven't you pulled the trigger?
Ask yourself this: ""What is holding me back?""
Are you afraid you'll actually learn what you've always said you would but never did?
Yeah, you'll have to put in the time and effort. If you're lazy, this course (or any other course or retirement calculator) won't be able to help you.
But if you're serious about learning comprehensively about retirement planning, management and its corresponding calculation, then I can definitely help you.
Plus, you have absolutely ZERO risk.
Udemy gives you a 30-day money back guarantee and they're really really good on that.

RE: A Financial Documentary of the Astounding Success of Nicolas Darvas
Dearstock investor,
It was the last earlysummerof the 1950s.
The Darvas brother and sisterdance teamwere as entrenched in the media then as Circe de Soleil is today. Theirgracefuldances delighted television viewers in Europe and America.
The Darvas name was regarded withrespectin show business circles in Las Vegas, New York, Toronto and far overseas. Nicolas Darvas hadcementedhis name in the public conscious as one of the best dancers worldwide.
Celebrities were shocked when a full page article inTime Magazinecovered Nicolas not as a dancer but as a rich stock investor ""who ignores tips, financial stories and broker’s letters."" This was followed with a 1960bookentitled, “How I Made $2,000,000 In The Stock Market.”   The book fell out of favor whenbusiness schoolsbegan teaching that the market could not be beaten by reasoned analysis.
And by The Way, He Made $2.5 Million in 6.5 Years.
Away from thepublichidden underneath arcane math exists recent evidence from the very top of investing that Darvas was correct.  See ** Moskowitz, T., Cliff Asness and Lasse Pedersen, “Value and Momentum Everywhere,” Journal of Finance (2012).
World class performancecomes from world class brains.  Darvas studied at theUniversity of Budapest— the most erudite of Hungary.
He wastrainednot just in classical dance but also as an economist.
Economicspaid less than dance.  But he was a brilliantscholarwith precise organization.
Thisallowedhim to precisely document his agonies and elations on a trade-by-trade basis, “I decided I had been missing a good thing all my life. I made up my mind to go into the stock market.  I have never gone back on this decision.”-Nicolas Darvas

Here Are The 25 School of Hard Knocks Worst Challenges for Beginning Stock Investors …
Nicolas Darvas faced many of thesame challengesat the start that I have.  That is part of the reason that hisclassic bookrings so true for so many stock investors in-the-know today.  Here is a sample of difficulties Darvas had toovercome.
CHALLENGE #1: BLIND LUCK.The first profit in stocks Darvaslandedwas not from his own thought process making him naively believe investing was easy.
CHALLENGE #2: GOSSIP.Nicolas Darvas in realizing that he knew nothing about stocks seeks the wisdom of random strangers leading to achaoticportfolio from asking “Do you know a good stock?”
CHALLENGE #3: MISFEASANCE.Neithercasualacquaintances in his travels nor brokers know the secret to making money in stocks.
CHALLENGE #4: COSTS.Brokeragecommissionsand transfer taxes decimate the initial stock market returns of Nicolas Darvas — and he realizes he must control them.
CHALLENGE #5: OVER-TRADING.Darvas fidgets for fast profits spreading his stake between upwards of thirty stocks — degrading control andtrackingwhile ramping up account depleting fees.
CHALLENGE #5: LOSER-LOVE.Nicolas became attached to particular stocks giving him the proclivity of holding lossexplodingfalling shares.
CHALLENGE #6: GAMBLERS-ANNONYMOUS.On stage this trained dancer was the pinnacle of disciplined control. Chasing afast buckover-trading stocks was quickly losing him two hundred dollars a day.
CHALLENGE #7:  GURUS.Nicolas Darvas wasattractedto advisory service that made speculation sound like a snap and fed his need for urgently making money fast but recommended falling stocks. Have you been spending hundreds or even thousands on investment newsletter financial advisory services?  If so, you have probably asked yourself, “where are all those hundred percent returns promised in the glossy marketing?”
CHALLENGE #8: DATES.Thefamousdancer does not know when to enter the market.  This pulls eleven thousand dollarsdownto five thousand eight hundred.
CHALLENGE #9:  TIPS.A broker offers up advice in the form of asafestock based on fundamentals — that drops.  Brokers arebadfor advice as well.
CHALLENGE #10:  PROJECTION.Darvas is quick toblamehis broker for mistakes truncating his ability to learn.
CHALLENGE #11: IGNORANCE.Even the greatest dancer in the world is aduncewithout an understanding of the jargon making it hard for Nicolas to communicate clearly with his broker — remember that this was before online trading and retail stock investors had to have a broker.
CHALLENGE #12:   VISION.Nicolas Darvas quicklyrealizesthat he cannot see the strongest trees in the forest and sets out to find the most strongly rising stocks.
CHALLENGE #13: LIQUIDITY.Darvas has a hard time reselling his small stocks in the chaotic discontinuously trading over-the-counter (OTC) market.
CHALLENGE #14: INSIDE-IDIOTS.The Hungarian trained economist gone world class classical dancer begins tracking inside trades of the largestexecutives.  He quickly finds that insiders don’t know any more about the direction of the stocks of the firms they manage than you do! And we confirmed this “too-late-too-soon” factoid in Brown, S., Cao-Alvira, J. & Powers, E. (2013). Do Investment Newsletters Move Markets? Financial Management, Vol. XXXXII, (2), 315-338.
CHALLENGE #15: OVER-CONFIDENCE.Fundamentalfilteringas is done widely with Value-Line leads Nicolas into the limbo land of false-hope.
CHALLENGE #16: REGRET-AVOIDANCE.If Darvas were alive today, he would begluedto the screen for fear of a loss on his stock.  He wastesmassiveamounts of energy over-monitoring his equity returns.
CHALLENGE #17: TOPPING-OUT.Buying into the very top of a run burnsNicolasout so he focuses on price consolidations he terms “boxes.”
CHALLENGE #18: EXHAUSTION.Chasing stocks justbecausethey rise brings his attention too late by the time the broker calls.
CHALLENGE #19: COIN-FLIP.Making more on profitable trades than is lost on losers becomes his mantra as he realizes that he isneverbetter at picking a winner than a simple coin toss — but that is pretty darn good!
CHALLENGE #20: DATA.Darvas realizes that hemusthave access to high quality data on not just price but also volume.
CHALLENGE #21: PAPER-TRADE-THIS.Nicolas eventually figures out that paper trading gets him nowhere — he has to beemotionallyinvolved.
CHALLENGE #22: DIONYSUS.In embracing the central truth that stocks owned and watched makeunexplainedprice collapses — and in so realizing understands that he is as knowledgeable as any guru.
CHALLENGE #23: TAX-PARALYSIS.
Many people hold on to stocks for more than a year for a lower tax rate on capital rather thanshort-termgains.  He decides that he has to sell even if thetaxeson his gains will he higher.
CHALLENGE #24: BUY-&-CRUMBLE.Holding stocks forvery long periods of timedoesn’t work for Nicolas Darvas — buy-&-hold strategies he decides are for gamblers,
CHALLENGE #25: CYCLE.Nicolas notices that stocks cycle from small to large in andout of fadcreating even less predictability.
Darvas was gifted enough to find his own way up and out into the light from deep within his initial darkness inPlato’s cavewith secrets he willingly shared to those even unborn who could understand.
Here’s 15 Cures for The 25 Worst Challenges for Stock Investors …
CURE #1:  TABLES.Tracking therelationshipbetween volume and price allowed Darvas to identify stocks with sudden explosions of volume.
CURE #2:  MOMENTUM.Simplybuyingstocks that are rising saves Nicolas Darvas.
CURE #3:  TRADING-VOLUME.The highest money makers are stocks withfastrising prices on accelerating volume.
CURE #4: BUSINESS.Darvas treats his stock investing as abusinessby giving it the required attention.
CURE #5: CHANNELS.Trend consolidations map entry and exitpointsfor Darvas.
CURE #6: BUY-STOP.Runaway stocks are captured from above by a simple limitstopbuy order.
CURE #7:  SELL-STOP.A simple sell limit stop-order saves Nicholas Darvas from beingwronghalf of the time.
CURE #8:  TEST-PURCHASE.Test purchase of 4 or fewer stocks work for Nicholas Darvas like risk cutting little experimental oil wells inwildcatting.
CURE #9: GODZILLA.A slumping stock market can stomp out even the strongest stock with the same dynamic as whenBambi Meets Godzillain 1969 — watch the classic movie on YouTube for more.
CURE #10: BOTTOM-LINE.Sharply up trending earnings foretell the strongest of the strong rising stocks onpumpedupvolume.
CURE #11: NEWCOMERS.Overtime the most important hunting ground for Darvas is new industries — these are more important thanspecific productswithin those sectors.
CURE #12:  MARGIN.Leverage dramatically increases the portfolio beta and the gain for Nicolas Darvas — today we usedeep in the money call options.
CURE #13: SAFETY.A critical rule becomes the resolute decision to never feed passive losses withactive income.
CURE #14: ENTITY.Nicolas Darvas could have used acorporate structureto reduce taxes — learn more inside.
CURE #15: ISOLATION.Independent thought becomes the saving grace for Darvas he can only find throughsolitudeas he stops all gossip and chat calls.
Once Darvasunderstoodwhat worked he began to reap huge benefits…

“I started by taking a finance refresher with Robert Schiller’s openYale course on Financial Markets. Then through a book recommendation for How I Made $2,000,000, I came across your Nicholas Darvas course which I thoroughly enjoyed. I think its your teaching style coupled with the simplistic message of volume, earnings, and making decisions as an individual that intrigue me. My finance courses in the past would teach you about equations and fundamentals, but you never encounter any real coaching on how to effectively invest.” -Gavin Ripley, MBA North Carolina; March 15, 2015

42645,"Backspreads, Diagonals and Butterflies - Advanced Strategies","THIS OPTION SPREADS COURSE COVERS THREE (3) ADVANCED OPTIONS STRATEGIES - BACKSPREADS, DIAGONALS AND BUTTERFLY SPREADS

SECTION I - BACKSPREADS AND RATIO SPREADS

Back Spread and Ratio  Spreads involve putting on an unbalanced amount of Long and Short Options. If  we have more Long Options than Short, the position is called a Back Spread and  if we have more Short Options than Long, the position is called a Ratio Spread.  In a Ratio spread, you have unlimited losses on one side because you have more  Short Options. The Back Spread can be  constructed in many creative ways, and we show you how you can manage different  strike prices as well as different ratios of Long and Short Options to  construct an optimal BackOption Spreads. We don't recommend Ratio spreads as they have an unlimited  loss potential.

What you will master
What is the philosophy of Back spreads and Ratio spreads
Different creative possibilities with the Back spread
How should we look at the Greeks in a Back Spread
Importance of understanding the ""Valley of death""
How should we avoid the valley of death
Why is this a Volatility strategy
Why do we not recommend a Ratio spread
Why is the back Spread a great trade for the busy professional


SECTION II - DIAGONALS AND DOUBLE DIAGONALS
The Diagonal is a variation of the Calendar time spread, and it tends to reduce the Vega exposure of a Calendar spread. Due to this fact, it also has a Delta bias when the trade is put on. It is important that you understand and become a master at trading Calendar spreads before you try a Diagonal spread. Although the Diagonal has very similar characteristics as a Calendar spread, the Diagonal is a complex variation of the Calendar spread. Just like in Calendars, the easiest adjustment to a Diagonal spread is to convert it into a Double Diagonal on the losing side, and the course covers this adjustment in detail. You will also benefit from a higher Theta decay than in regular Calendars, however the compromise you make is that the risk exposure in higher than a Calendar, and you also have a Delta bias.
What you will master
What are Diagonals and how do they differ from Calendars
Why are they difficult to adjust
What are the normal adjustments for a Diagonal
How the double diagonal increases your profit zone and your max profit area
Why does Diagonals have better Theta decay than Calendars
Why do Diagonals reduce the impact of Vega
Why is there a higher risk in Diagonals than Calendars

SECTION III - BUTTERFLY SPREADS
The Butterfly is a low  risk, high reward, and low probability strategy. The Butterfly involves 3  different Options including Long and Short options, so it can be a bit  difficult to manage once its put on. But the Butterfly can produce great  results if it works, and in many cases the cost of the Butterfly is minimal,  and if you're lucky, you may even receive a credit for the Butterfly. Both  these trades are generally put on by hardcore Options traders. The Butterfly  trade should not be your regular ""bread and butter"" trade in the  sense that you can't rinse and repeat this strategy all the time for consistent  monthly income. But the Butterfly can be an excellent strategy in very specific  circumstances - like protecting the losing side of an Iron condor or a credit  spread. Another great application for the Butterfly is during an earnings  report. Both of these specific applications are covered in detail in this  course of Advanced Options Strategies.

What you will master
Why is the Butterfly a low risk, high reward strategy
What is the probability of the Butterfly producing fantastic results
How do we adjust Butterflies
Why the Butterfly is a speculative strategy
Why is the Butterfly not a ""bread and butter"" trade

45136,Weekly Options and study of Options expiration dynamics,"WEEKLY OPTIONS TRADING AND  OPTION EXPIRATION DYNAMICS
The impact of time  decay on Option prices in the final week before expiry is an exciting  phenomenon. We know time decay is exponential, but how do the Greeks actually  behave during this time. This course on Trading Options at Expiration takes a deep dive using Apple (AAPL) Options Weekly series. We follow an AAPL Short Straddle trade from Thursday morning  until deep into the following week. The Short Straddle is explained in detail  in this course. The Greeks  are on steroids during the final week of an Option's life.
Option Greeks behave  abnormally during the final week, especially the At-The-Money Options. It  should be intuitive that these Options are experiencing an enormous amount of  uncertainty insofar as to whether they will end up in-the-money or not. What  may not be clear is how the Greeks behave during this time which ultimately  impacts Option prices.
Most importantly, the  lectures focus on the kinds of strategies that are ideal during the final two  weeks before expiry. Although most strategies tend to focus on the most dominant  Options characteristic during this time (Time Decay), the course also shows a  couple of very interesting, very high reward strategies with very little risk.

What characteristics do Options have when they are very close to expiry

42651,Straddles and Strangles - Volatility moves in any direction,"
STRADDLE & STRANGLE OPTION STRATEGIES
Straddles and Strangles are also Volatility strategies and are very popular strategies. Both these strategies are non-directional, so its possible to profit from a movement in either direction. But the move must come fairly quickly, because we have two Long Options (one on the Call side and one on the Put side), and so our time decay exposure is doubled. Additionally, Vega exposure can be quite large, so this is something to watch for. In general, its best to put on Straddles and Strangles in times of low volatility as measured by the individual Implied Volatility of the stock itself as well as observing the level of the VIX Index. We also look at the ""Valley of Death"" where the trade can fall into trouble.
Straddles and Strangles fall into two categories of Strategies - 1) Non-directional strategies and 2) Volatility strategies.
In non-directional strategies, you don’t care if the Stock goes up or down. Your strategy profits from a move in either direction. The strategy starts out Delta Neutral – or at least you should try to construct it that way. But this does not mean your position will remain Delta neutral forever. In fact, your position will achieve a +ve Delta or a -ve Delta bias, depending on the stock’s movement. But these strategies have one clear advantage over others. You don’t have to be right in forecasting the direction of stock movement, and that fact alone put Straddle & Strangle strategies in our Favorites.

42197,Options Spreads Bundle-  the heart of Options Trading,"SECTION I - PHILOSOPHY AND DEFINITION OF SPREADS
We introduce all four Options Spreads in this Bundle (Bull Call, Bear Call, Bull Put and Bear Put). This bundle is a very comprehensive coverage of all four Option spreads. Options spreads sit right in between the 4 basic Option positions and the more Advanced level Option strategies. The Spread is the bridge between the basic Option strategies and the advanced strategies. In fact, most advanced strategies are composed of the spreads we cover in this course, so this stuff is key. For the busy professional, Spreads offer the right mix of reward and risk. All 4 vertical spreads introduced in this course are extensions of the 4 basic Options. Spreads add an element of cost control and / or risk control to individual Options positions. Master the four Options Spreads, and you would have acquired a skill that can create consistent monthly income. Additionally, you'll be well on your way to mastering the advanced Options strategies.

What you will master

Control risk and costs without compromising on Probability

SECTION - II REAL LIVE TRADES ON THE 4 OPTION SPREADS
THE BULL CALL SPREAD
The Bull Call Spread is an extension of the Long Call Option. When you buy a Call Option, you are bullish. The Bull Call spread maintains the bullish element of the Long Call while controlling your costs and has a limited losses profile. Of course, everything is a compromise. But you would probably be willing to make this compromise. We explain why this spread is called a Bull Call spread, and how to address any confusion from these strange names. The risk-reward profile of a Bull Call spread is very favorable. We define why the Bull Call spread is a Debit spread, and study its Profit and Loss diagrams in detail. We put a real trade on IBM and we navigate the trade for a couple of weeks.

What you will master

How does the Bull Call reduce your costs
What do we give up when we put on a Bull Call spread
What are the criteria for a good Bull Call spread
Put a real Bull Call spread on IBM and understand the position
Analyze, simulate the trade through various stages of the trade
Put the trade in context with the overall market condition
Analyze exit points carefully and execute the exit

THE BEAR CALL SPREAD
The Bear Call Spread is a credit spread, and we explain why credit spreads are a viable way to assuming an Option seller's profile. The Bear Call spread limits your risk. We study the role of Probability in selecting credit spreads as well as Implied volatility considerations and time decay. Time decay is a key component of credit spreads and the Bear Call spread can be an excellent way to generate monthly income. All spreads can be part of the busy professional's playbook, but credit spreads can be especially attractive. We analyze the right criteria for credit spreads, including the selection of the expiry series as well as the individual Options itself. We put a real trade on Amazon (AMZN) and track, monitor and adjust this trade until its exit.

THE BEAR PUT SPREAD

This example should make it absolutely clear what a Call Option is in step-by-step details. The course first defines what Options are, and in particular, what a Call Option is. It explains the differences between Option buyers and sellers, and the differences in their risk and reward profile. Several basic Options concepts like At-the-money, Out-of-the-money, and In-the-Money Options, and Risk Graphs are also introduced in this course.

Put Options increase in value when the value of a stock or index drops in price. We define what a Put Option, and just like we did in the Call Option, we consider a real-world example of a Put Option. Fortunately, we have excellent examples of Put Options in real life - when we buy Insurance for our car or home, we are actually buying a Put Option. This example should make it absolutely clear what a Put Option is.

Robert M says""Financial modeling made simple.  Being a CFO I've built my fair share of financials models as well, but I can say I never quite felt comfortable with them. They seemed too big, too cumbersome, and it just seemed like there should be a better way. Chris definitely knows what he is doing and couldn't be a better instructor. Finally I feel empowered to build a solid financial model, in less time, and with much better quality.

This course will be taught primarily by following along in Excel as we build a financial model for a fictional company.  We will start with a completely blank Excel workbook, and by the end of the course have a fully functioning financial model.
Students are encouraged to take the course twice.  The first time, just follow along, understand not only the formulas, but also the ""why"" of what we are doing.  See the financial model grow and become ""alive"" as we work through the various tabs.  The second time, follow along and work on your own personal financial model.
The time of the course in video content is 5.5 hours, although expect to spend 10 - 20 hours taking this course.  In that time we will build a basic financial model which is fully functioning.  The additional time is so you can work on your own financial model in between the lectures.
The course is structured in a very step by step methodology.  As we work through each section, we'll progress towards the final financial model.
I encourage all entrepreneurs and financially minded people alike to take the course.

I will help you!

180384,Yield Curve Dynamics,"In the finance business,a yield curve is used to visually display the current conditions of the market, and specifically some particular fixed income product (such as a corporate bond, or government note). The yield curve is a snapshot of interest rates in that market at a point in time, plotting the“yield to maturity”on the vertical axis and the “time to maturity” on the horizontal axis.A yield curve also is sometimes referred to as “the term structure of interest rates.”
Simply put, if you are involved in the financial markets on any level (as an investor, analyst, salesperson, banker, advisor, or trader) you must understand what yield curves are, how they work (with changes in economic conditions, market movements, government policy, etc.), and you must be able to explain these curves to lay-people (including your colleagues and clients).
In this course, we dive deep into yield curves, although we start out with the basics:

What is a yield curveand how is it “constructed?
Why do yield curves matter?
What is“duration” and how does that impact the shape of the curve?
How is duration used infinancial and market analysis
What are“spot” and “forward” rates
What is“total return analysis?”
If you want to “look smart” and BE smart in the investment management, investment banking, investor advisory and other related financial fields, this course is a MUST, not merely “optional.”

714188,"Fixed Income Valuation and Analysis, CFA L2","This course covers the curriculum of Fixed Income as contained in the CFA Level 1 curriculum. It is split into two Study sessions containing 4 readings.
As this is a very complex and technical topic, at the same time being one of the most important topics for CFA, I have simplified it for ease of understanding of the students.
The course contains approximately 4 hours of video lectures, split in short lectures to make it convenient for students, supporting reading material and topic based tests to ensure that taught topics are well understood by the students.
The first study session on ""Valuation Concepts"" covers essential knowledge and skills needed for the valuation of
fixed income investments. It begins with a discussion of the term structure of interest
rates and interest rate dynamics. The following reading addresses arbitrage-free valuation
of fixed-income securities. The study session concludes with an introduction to the
valuation and analysis of bonds with embedded options.
The second Study Session ""Topics in Fixed Income Analysis"" consists of a discussion of credit analysis and how credit standards
affect liquidity.
Students taking CFA Level 2 exam must take this course for understanding this complex topic. I would also recommend those students enrolled in CFA Level 3 to take this course who struggled with the basic concepts of fixed income in Level 1 and 2 so that their foundation improves for Fixed Income portfolio management in Level 3.

902150,Learn Global Macro Trading & Investing for Retail Investor,"Are you sick and tired because your investment is still at a loss after...
The fact is, Value Investing is only applicable on 2 conditions...
But if you are already fully invested and short of cash to invest, there wasn't much you can do when the market is indeed in deep discount.
At other times though, knowing about Value Investing isn't very useful if the market is not a deep discount.
Now, value investing principles also tell us:
""Wait for it to come back up!""or""The market is irrational!""
The fact is, it is easier said than done.
It would be easy to brush off the statements I made above, if not for the fact that the market can go further down, or sideways… for a horrifyingly long time.
If you only know how Value Investing, what are you going to do when the market condition is not favorable for it?
You sit and wait. For months? For years?
Is there a better way?
Yes, there is. If Warren Buffett is the Jedi of Value Investing, then his Sith Lord equivalent would be George Soros. Most only knows George Soros as the man who rise to fame afer breaking the Bank of England in the 90's, but little is known about his investing strategy.
This course aims to dissect & conceptualize his little known investing strategies which can be applied by retail investor both in bull and bear market. Such strategies can be used on top of Value Investing strategy; because knowing both is akin to having powerful knowledge from both sides of the Force - the Light and the Dark.
----------
You might think - ""I can learn global macro trading elsewhere, why should I learn from you?""
No, you can't. Go google about the detailed explanations of George Soros' global macro trading strategy and try to find someone that not only how to implement but also GIVES you examples on its use. Also, the way I teaches about how macroeconomics related to business cycles and monetary policies,  I've looked and it's not there.
----------
""Can you make me rich by taking your course?""
No way! Not just from taking the course. Anyone who promises you that is selling snake oil.
If you learn global macro trading AND apply the lessons to make smarter invests in the future, then you have a chance.
What I can guarantee is that you will leave with some perspectives how to invest better in today's volatile market.

41961,"Options Foundation - Time Decay, Implied Volatility, Greeks","
SECTION I - TIME DECAY
Time decay is a pivotal component of Options strategies. In fact, time decay alone is responsible for the majority of advanced option strategies. In this part of the course, we are going to study the concept in detail. Options are ""wasting"" assets, and they lose value every day. The buyer gets hurt from time decay and the seller benefits from it. And time decay becomes more exponential as we approach expiry of an Option. It is also the great equalizer between the profiles of a buyer and seller of Options. Time decay is the great equalizer in the risk / reward profiles of buyers and sellers of Options. Several intermediate and advanced strategies are based on selling premium (option sellers) and these positions make a profit due to time decay in the value of these options over a period of time.
What you will master
What is time decay and how does it benefit Option sellers
A complete recap of buyer and seller risk and reward profiles
Why does the seller of Options not want movement in the Stock
Why is Time decay the great equalizer between buyers and sellers of Options
Apply the concept of time decay to our real world examples

Demonstration of time decay using AAPL Options
SECTION II - IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND OPTION PRICES
Implied Volatility is the ""wildcard"" in Option prices. Ignore it, and you will pay a price. In fact, it's so important we have at least four different varieties - Volatility, Implied Volatility, Historical Volatility, and Future or Expected Volatility. We use the real-world examples to explain the concept of Volatility in simple terms. Then we study how Volatility is quantified in Stocks and Options. And how Volatility finds a back-door to embed itself into Option prices. Implied Volatility considerations are critical when choosing between a buyer and seller profile. We break this complex topic down into simple terms and show you an example of NFLX and CAT options that should make it absolutely clear what this is all about.
What you will master
How are Option prices determined and is there an unknown variable
Why is it difficult to calculate or determine Implied Volatility of an Option
Why is this called ""implied"" Volatility
How does Implied Volatility manifest itself into Option prices

If you're the pilot of an aircraft, the Greeks are your instrument panel. If you don't manage your instrument panel properly, well...you get the picture. Understanding the Greeks are absolutely critical to every Option position. We break this course into easy to understand chapters for all the four Greeks - Delta, the king of all Greeks. Gamma - the silent operator. Theta - every Option seller's dream. And Vega - Watch out for this one.. Most beginners to Options tend to ignore the Greeks. Master the Greeks and you'll shave off months of learning curve. Not to mention, you can then fly your aircraft on ""auto-pilot"" (with help from the Greeks).

We explain the important processes like Exercise and Assignment, as well as things like Expiry series, Bid-Ask spreads, Brokerage and transaction costs and various other details. What is Open Interest and why is it important, and what is the role of a Market Maker. We study the different Order types and which ones are important for the average investor, and which ones make sense in different situations.

In this course, we take the example of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and show how the trade played out. We analyze the rationale behind entering the trade, the risk/reward profile, chart analysis and point of entry, choice of expiry and ""moneyness"" of the Option, time decay considerations, margin requirements, profit expectations, exit criteria, Greek analysis, its Profit and Loss profile and various other considerations.

Buying a Put Option serves two purposes - exploit a bearish move in the stock or be the ultimate protector of your stock. In this part of the course, we take the example of the Euro ETF (FXE) and show how the trade played out in about 25 days time. We analyze the rationale behind entering the trade, the risk/reward profile, chart analysis and point of entry, choice of expiry and ""moneyness"" of the Option, time decay considerations, margin requirements, profit expectations, exit criteria, Greek analysis, its Profit and Loss profile and various other considerations. We provide a 360-degree analysis before trade entry. We show you how to ""let your winners run"" in a controlled manner.

SECTION III - STRATEGY AND OPTIMIZATION
The Option strategy optimization course brings all the 4 Options strategies together. The 4 strategies are comprised of 2 bullish and 2 bearish strategies, but how and when should we choose a particular strategy over the other. We create a helpful ""4 strategies box"" to distinguish and connect one strategy to the other. Most importantly, what are all the considerations before we choose a strategy. Our choice of strategy depends not only on what the stock is currently doing, but also on various market externalities as well as a few key Option metrics like Implied Volatility.

Which Option should we choose to optimize our outlook

SECTION IV - SINGLE OPTION ADJUSTMENTS
This course studies the need for Option adjustments, and why adjustments are as critical to the success of your position as good entry or analysis. We consider all the four basic strategies - the Long Call, Short Call, Long Put, and the Short Put and look at various adjustments to these positions if they get into trouble. Every investor has a ""pain point"" - this is the point at which they adjust their position. Applying a rigorous approach to this pain point enables investors to control risk while maximizing the opportunity to profit. The course also discusses various details like early adjustments, over-adjusting and adjusting profitable trades as well as the importance of the investor's outlook for the stock when considering adjustments.
What you will master
What are adjustments and why do we need to adjust positions
Why adjustments are a feature of Options that should be taken advantage of
What are the considerations for making a good adjustment
Are adjustments different for different strategies

What is over-adjustment and why we should try to avoid it

1020244,Mental Models For Wall Street - Become A Better Trader,"""It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.""
- Charlie Munger
Welcome toMental Models For Wall Street.
On this course we are going to investigate a number of mental models and how they can help you win in finance and business - particularly in the realm of trading and investing.
You are going to discover crucial models and frameworks like:
- The Availability Bias- Confirmation Bias- Misconceptions of Chance- The Black Swan- The Law of Small Numbers- Cognitive Dissonance- Margin of Safety- Aversion to Losses- Feedback Loops- And lots more...
Financial traders, investors and entrepreneurs will benefit most from this course as we delve into topics that will teach you about yourself, improve your judgement skills and insulate you from costly mistakes.
For example, by learning about psychological models like confirmation bias and hindsight bias you will be better equipped to eliminate their negative effects and make better decisions in the stock market.
By learning about cognitive dissonance, anchoring and fear of missing out you'll finally understand why you sometimes make strange, illogical decisions. And how this can help you in the trading world.
Concepts such as circle of competence, margin of safety and Mr. Market will further help you to make better timed investment moves while protecting your downside risk.
Also, you will learn to calculate better probabilities using Bayes Theorem, improve your systematic processes using feedback loops and minimise overconfidence by understanding concepts such as regression to the mean.
You will learn all this and more – by utilising the power of mental models detailed on this course!
But, what is a mental model?
Well, a mental model in it’s simplest form is an idea that helps us understand how the world works.
Having a large array of these models at our fingertips gives us great tools we can use to solve problems and navigate life.
Why do we need mental models?
The world is complicated so you can’t rely on just remembering facts, you need to have multiple models from all different disciplines in your head.
But even though there is so much to learn, there are shortcuts we can take.
By studying the big ideas from the big disciplines. Disciplines like psychology, economics, maths, physics and engineering we can go a long way in a short amount of time.
And that’s the whole concept behind Mental Models. They're shortcuts you can take to speed up your learning and become knowledgeable about the world.
The focus of this course
On this course, we will look at the most important mental models, the ones most crucial for success. And we will relate them to the business of financial trading and investing.
These models will help you to make better investment decisions, solve complex problems and avoid costly errors.

1214144,¡Triunfar en La Bolsa de Valores No Requiere de Experiencia!,"Recientemente pude entrevistar el tercer inversionista más famoso del mundo,Mohnish Pabrai. WarrenBuffety CharlieMungerle anteceden en esta lista, y le proveen de inspiración y ejemplo
El Sr. Pabrai cuenta la historia de un bibliotecario que murió en 2015 con una herencia de $4 millones la cual donó a laUniversidad de New Hampshire (UNH).
Mohnish nos explica una estrategia que le permitiría a un adolescente cualquiera con pocas destrezas y salario mínimo alcanzaréxito financiero.
El joven empleado deMcDonald’s, Cocinero, recibirá $15,000 anuales producto de 2,000 horas de trabajo a salario mínimo. Este joven podríaahorrarun 10% y contribuir a los gastos del hogar con el otro 90%. Los $1,500 anuales, tomados de su salario bruto pueden ser depositados en una cuentaROTH IRA(luego de impuestos) o en una cuentaIRATradicional (previo a impuestos).
Este ejemplo es unoconservador. Con motivo de simplificar, se presume que nuestro joven de 18 años no recibe pareo por concepto de su participación en un plan de pensiones401(K)auspiciado por su empleador.
Es decir, se subestiman losdepósitos.
Suponiendo que su estrategia de inversión genera un 9% derendimientoanual. Ajustando los depósitos por concepto de inflación; es decir que un 2% de inflación incrementa la contribución anual a $1,530.
Cincuenta años más tarde, a laedadde 68 años,Cocinerohabrá ahorrado $75,000 de salario bruto.
Según lareglade 72, el tiempo que le toma a un depósito original para duplicarse se puede estimar dividiendo la cifra de 72 entre la tasa de rendimiento promedio obtenido. En nuestro caso, 8 años: = 72 ÷ 9%.
¿A cuánto crecerán estos $ 15,000 de depósitos anuales al termino de 50 años, utilizando un 9% de rendimiento?
Respuesta:$ 1,332,662
Lo anterior puede verificarse enBankratepunto com utilizando los datos provistos anteriormente para nuestro joven empleado no diestro.
¿Te parece esto razonable?
El libro más respetado en las inversiones,""Essentials of Investments"" por los profesoresBodie, Kane y Marcus. En su capítulo dedicado a laTeoría de Cartera de Inversiónnos informa que, durante el período de 1920 a 2010, una cartera de acciones compuesta de pequeñas empresas estadounidenses obtuvo unrendimientopromedio de 11.80%, 9.62% para una de empresas grandes y un 9.21% para una cartera de acciones internacionales.
Los datos anteriores son promediosgeométricosbasados en acciones de mercado.
Si nuestro jovenCocinerohubiese utilizado instrumentos de inversión ETF tales como Diamonds (DIA) o Spiders (SPDR), su rendimiento promedio hubiese sido 9.62% para el mismo periodo.
El éxito financiero de la estrategia de inversión discutida por elSr. Pabraise debe a los efectos de una tasa de rendimiento compuesta y del factor tiempo.
El fondo deinversiónmanejado por Prabai, por ejemplo, ha obtenido un rendimiento promedio de 15% durante sus años de existencia. Lo que aplicado a nuestro ejemplo del joven empleado de McDonald’s significaría un balance de cuenta de $12,450,561 al termino de 50 años. Diez veces elresultadoanterior resultado de un 6% de rendimiento adicional.

One of the biggest discoveries were that high-performing stocks formed key price patterns before breaking out and making their investors rich.
O'Neil used that knowledge to achieve staggering returns which helped him gain a seat on the New York Stock Exchange while in his 20's and also funded the start-up of the Investor's Business Daily which grew into a billion-dollar publishing empire.

It was an incredible feat that set records and was documented publicly by both his accountants as well as Forbes magazine.

793084,Succeed in Stocks Even if you Don't Know Where to Start,"I recently interviewed one of the three mostfamousvalue investors in the world.  The firsttwoare Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.
Mohnish Pabrai drawswisdomfrom both.  He describes alibrarianwho died with an estate of $4 million.  The librariandonatedit to the University of New Hampshire (UNH) in 2015 according to CNBC.
Mohnish explains that any normal eighteen-year-old with very few skills who can only get a minimum wage job can make it.
The young McDonald’s worker earns minimum wage of $15,000 for 2,000 hours of work per year. He can save ten percent because he islivingat home and contributing 90% to the household budget.
The young man sets aside ten percent of $15,000 beforetaxeseach year. The 18-year-oldsaves$1,500 each year into a Roth (after taxes) or employer sponsored IRA (before taxes).
This is aconservativeexample. The young man (for ease of example) does not get a boost from employer matching if he saves in an employer sponsored 401(k). This would allow him to save muchmore.
He earns 9% on a simple investment choice.  His income rises modestly withinflation.  For instance, if inflation is 2% this year he will save $1,530 in thenext.
When heretires50 years from now at the age of 68 he will have saved $75,000 over the years from his salary.
At 9%, the accountdoublesevery 8 years as per the rule of 72.  The approximate time to double an account is the number 72 divided by the rate of return on the investment.
How Much Does $75,000 of Drip Savings Grow at 9% in 50 Years? Answer: $1,332,662
Bankrate website has acalculatorthat shows that this scenario will produce a retirement account for the unskilled, minimum wage 18-year-old of $1,332,662.
Is this reasonable?
The mostrespectedtextbook on investments is “Essentials of Investments” by professors Bodie, Kane and Marcus.  The chapter on portfolio theoryreportsthat a portfolio of small U.S. stocks returned 11.80%, large U.S. stocks returned 9.62%, and world stocks 9.21%.
These are the geometric meanreturnsthat investors enjoyed from 1920 to 2010 in the stock market.
A simple exchange traded fund such as theDiamond —SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA)would have allowed this unskilled 18-year-old to capture a large stock return of 9.62% over that period.
The financialsuccessof this 18-year-old comes from the power of compounding over a long time.  The Pabrai fund has generated averagereturnsof about 15%.
This higher return would generate a $12,450,561portfoliofor the eighteen-year-old.  A difference of just over 5% produces a fortune nearlytentimes greater!

But first let me give you abackgroundfrom which to understand.
The Untold History of Puerto Rico
At slightly less than three times Rhode Island Puerto Rico is thethird largest isle in the United States.   That's a hundred and ten by forty miles of prime Caribbean acreage basking in a year round climateranging between 70 and 96 degreesFahrenheit at 18.45⁰ latitude slightly north of the equator. This Latin paradise of eternal spring is part of Jimmy Buffet's most coveted Caribbean sailing grounds.
OnlyHawaii's Big Island and Kodiak Island in Alaskaare larger.
Thelush tropical landsits on a foundation of190-million-year old rock.  The massivesubduction zoneslopes into the largest and deepest trench of the frigid Atlantic to the east.
Thebackbone of the island paradiseis a range that composes two thirds of the land mass.  It climbs to4,393 feet above sea level.
Thecentral Puerto Rico cordilleraforms the rim of a massive eastern bowl that shelters and warms theCaribbean Sea to the west.  Sections are ofan unexpected breathtaking beautynormally discovered on a major continent in places as majestic as California's Yosemite or Washington's Olympic Peninsula.
It also creates the canvas for more than adozen ecological micro climes.
The most arid of these in the south are reminiscent ofdesertsalong the southern Arizona border.  The most humid isEl Yunque, the only tropical rainforest in theNational Park System.
The Caribbean Basin Drive for Increased Employment
TheBahamaslevy neither income, capital gains nor inheritance tax.  But the problem over yonder is that you have to deal with thepolitical riskof aforeign government.
The only choices you have forsafely owningyour piece of perpetual paradise withUnited States Federal property protection and tax benefitsare St. Thomas, St. Croix, or Puerto Rico.
The U.S. Virgin Islandsoffer a 90% exemption from U.S. income taxes and 100% exemption from all other taxes and duties if you qualify.  You do receiveproperty protectionfrom the United States federal government.
Thismitigates political risk.
But over in that neck of our aquatic sports range you end up living on atropical dirt speck the size of a postage stamp.  Ditto for the slightly larger butrelatively desolate islandof St. Croix.
I am sure that you won't be surprised to learn thatIsland feveris the leading cause of exit from theUnited States Virgin Islandswithin a few years of relocating.
Most Americans think that Puerto Rico is athird world country.Think again.

Every time I crunch it through I consistently conclude that Puerto Rico is the best place for you to enjoy aJimmy Buffet lifestyleon a Warren Buffet budget of tax savings.

These benefits are bestowed onfinancial services firmswilling to relocate to ourEnchanted Isle— and home of theuber-cute Coqui frog.
Amazingly,the benefitsare best for retired ultra-high net worth individuals living on portfolio income.  And I think you will enjoy a refreshing change to …
A Blended Culture Devoid of Slavery Anger!
This derives from ahistory largely unmarred by slavery.  Slaves at peak population never numbered more thanone or two out of tenAfricans or descendants during the 1700s in Puerto Rico.
Perhaps this is from thelingering local distasteof the initial enslavement byPonce de Leonof theTaino Indiansin a tortuous fluvial gold panning system.  This resulted in bloody rebellion and thewrath of Queen Isabela.Taino descendantspopulate Puerto Rico as do their ideas and memories.
This contrasts starkly with theUnited States, Cuba and the Dominican Republicwhere 9 out of 10 people from Africa were slaves.
Puerto Rican culture offers arefreshing color blindnessbequeathed by a history largely devoid of such oppression.
Also unique was the fact thatEuropeans outnumbered Africanthroughout the post Taino Indian history in Puerto Rico.Cuba and the Dominican Republicwere over 90% Africans with regard to total population at the time.
Nearly all were slaves.
TheSpanish censusreveals that the 583,181-person population of Puerto Rico was listed as just fourteen percent slaves of total and interestingly sixteen percent of “colored.”  This was in 1860 well before the1873 abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico.
Not surprisingly there areno racial riotsin Puerto Rico.
TheSpanish languagespoken on the island is pleasantlydevoid of sub-dialectsarising from the unjust brutality of slavery.
For further reading see ""The Puerto Ricans - A Documentary History"" byKal and Olga Wagenheim.
The True Birthplace of the Puerto Rican Independence Movement
The hunger for self-determination began rather inauspiciously with the birth ofRamón Emeterio Betanceson April 8, 1827.  As Ramón matured into a competentEuropean trained ophthalmologistandFreemasonhe grew to loathe the ravaging governance of mother Spain.
Even more he despised theCastilian acceptance of slavery.  He was thrown off the island forbuying child slaveswhom he wouldimmediately free.
HisFreemason connectionsfollowed a freedom network that connects to thefathers of the American Revolution.
Dr. Betances, thepolitical refugeeeventually landed in New York.    He gained the respect of Congress after convincing the legislature to vote against theannexation of theDominican Republic.
His argument rested on theinviolable right of a people to self-determine.
Betances is widely recognized as the father of thePuerto Rico Independence Movement. HisFreemason philosophyconnected his Caribbean cry for revolution with that of our own.  His written pamphlets from 1867 closely resonate the thinking ofBen FranklinandThomas Jefferson:
The Right to Reject All Taxes
These are theTEN COMMANDMENTSof Free Men according to Betances.
His 31year battle for independence ended in decree that Puerto Rico would be shaken loose from acollapsing Spanish government.  The strongest evidence of the full faith of Spain's intention was thecommissioning of sovereign coinagefor the island.
ThePuerto Rico pattern coinwas formed in 1890.
Thedesign was finalizedwith the issuance of 5, 10, 20, 40 centavo and 1 peso numismatics minted in 1895 and 1896.  The one-ounce sterling silver Pesois the crown jewel of the 11 piece series.
""Dame un Peso"" does not refer to aU.S. Dollar.
By August of 1898 thePuerto Rican populacewas eagerly awaiting the arrival ofKing Alfonsofrom Spain for the formal act of separation followed by planned joyous celebration.
Just Weeks Away From Sovereign Independence...
TheUnited States of Americainvaded Puerto Rico in July 25th of 1898.
The idea was to create a force as large and powerful as theBritish Royal Navy. The strategy called forcontrol of marine routesrelated to thePanama Canal.
Puerto Rican coinagewas truncated after its second year of issuance.  However, the Spanish symbolism of Puerto Rico'sephemeral sovereign natureresonates through the local government today.
For the next 19 years Puerto Ricans were exploited as little more thanindentured slavesby largeAmerican corporations.  These were extensions of an already thrivingUnited States banana republicin Central America.
Locals werecompliant from acclimationin the Hacienda ""ficha"" system of the Spaniards.  This process came to a grinding halt when the Jones Act conferredUnited States citizenshipto Puerto Ricans in 1917.
Citizenship was received withmixed feelings.  Roughly half of Puerto Ricans wantedstatehood.
The restwanted nothing of the sort.
APro-Statehood Party (PNP)developed within the population.
Two prominent Puerto Ricans, poetLuis Muñoz Marínandpharmacy chain mogul Teodoro Moscosonegotiated with Congress to secure the right of Puerto Ricans to self-determine.
They worked in conjunction with Congress appointedgovernor Rexford Tugwell.  The renownedColumbia economics professorwas highly supportive of both men.
Over his tenure Governor Tugwell had come to love the people andHispanic culture of Puerto Rico.  He did not want it erased by themandatory linguistic impositionthat American-English statehood would unequivocally create.
TheAmerican melting potcould not tolerate a second official language.
Tugwell used hisinfluence in Congressthat dated as far back as Frankin D. Roosevelt's ""Brain Trust"" that led up to the New Deal.    His input as anexperimental economistwas an important guiding force throughout the process.
AFree Associated Statemodel was developed and approved in Congress.
This conferredtaxation, insurance, and retirement plan autonomyto the Puerto Rican government in 1947. Medicare and social security benefits for locals are restricted and residents cannot vote in aUnited States presidential ellection.
This created the onlyforeign tax systemwithin the borders of the United States.
The combined brilliance ofMarín, Moscoso, and Tugwellhad birthed the first political economic system that ensured the preservation of the localHispanic culture and language.
ThisFree Associated State model of Puerto Ricohas many parallels with that of both theAmerican Stateand theEuropean Union (EU)systems.  The theory that led to the EU was published in the 1960s by Bagwell’s Columbia economics fellow faculty memberRobert Mundell.
Professor Mundell won theNobel Prizefor his work that formed the European Union.
Luis Muñoz Marínbecame the first Puerto Rican governor elected by a popular majority of thePuerto Rican people.
The Free Associated State was immediately recognized by thePro-Statehood (PNP)populace as antithetic to statehood.  The right to vote put power into the hands of both sides.
Ironically, the mostfervent separatistsalso viewed the new situation as antithetic to independence.  ThelocalFreemasonmovementstarted so many years ago by Dr. Betances quickly evolved into aPro-Independence Party (PIP).
The newPopular Party (PPD)under governor Marín sought to form afree associated commonwealthwith the United States as had been planned pre-invasion with Spain.
Both parties seek adegree of autonomybut in a different way.
For this reason, you may hear the Popular Party (PPD) referred to as awatermelon. Thegreencolor of the Pro-independence camp wraps around theredof the Popular party.
The pro-statehood party color is the samenavyblue of the American flag.  Theblue of the Puerto Rican flagthat flies on the governor’s mansion oscillates between navy and original powder blue depending on the party of the sitting governor.
The lack of a clear vision for an acceptable path to independence has led to thenear extinctionof the PIP party today.  And there has never been a sitting governor from theindependence party.
Meanwhile, theFree Associated Statehas flourished into a working synergy between thePopular Party, thePro-Statehoodparty, and theCongress of the United States.
Economic Development in Puerto Rico
Teodoro Moscoso became the firstadministrator of economic development.  He createdOperation Bootstrapin 1947 to transition Puerto Rico from an agrarian to an industrial society.
Ashrinking farm job marketforced lesser skilled but now passport holding Puerto Ricans to the United States.West Side Storyis a portrayal of conflict between dislocated lower classPuerto Rican householdsand those of other New York immigrants competing for menial jobs.
Nonetheless Puerto Ricans thrived giving rise to superstars such asJennifer Lopez,Marc Anthony,Raul Julia,Ricky Martin,Rita Morena, José FerrerandBenico del Toro.  And that is just theentertainment field.  Most Americans know that theHonorable Sonia Sotomayoris the first Hispanic United States Supreme Court Justice.
ThePuerto Rican Diasporacenters aroundNew York,Chicago, andFlorida.
Attempts atdeveloping industries around heavy productswere eventually throttled by high freight costs.  The negotiation that formed theFree Associated Statecame with the agreement that all freight on and off island would come and go by vessel flying an American flag under theJones Act.
The next phase ofeconomic developmentunderSection 936focused on high value products with low weight.Margins on featherweight productsare insulated from high freight costs.
Section 936 tax exclusions created avibrant hub of pharmaceutical firms.  PresidentBill Clintonsquashed the program.
This stripped the island of betweenfifty and one hundred thousandhighly skilled pharmaceutical jobs.
The New American Dream — The Puerto Rico World-Class Export Service Sector Super Hub
In 2008Harvard trained governorAníbal Salvador Acevedo Vilásigned into existence ActNo. 73-2008.   This new law reestablished atax benefit systemdesigned to incentivize the relocation to Puerto Rico of commercial scale firms.
It is intended to repair theeconomic craterfrom the loss of Section 936 through thecreation of new jobson the island.  This aligns well with thePopular Party's utopian ""Jibaro"" philosophythat only hard Criollo work will guarantee ""bread, land, and liberty.""
The Popular Party desired thestrongest possible tax incentivesto repair the damage of extensive job loss from theClinton Administration.  And fortunately, pro-statehoodPNP partysuccessorLuis Guillermo Fortuño Bursetgave his full support of the formation of avibrant export services hub in Puerto Rico— in return for tax incentives.
Act No. 73 wasgradually overhauled.  In 2012 it was signed into new form asAct 20 and Act 22by new PNP governor Luis Fortuño.

In section 2 I delve a little deeper into individual psychology and explain how our default mental programing dictates the emotions we feel and the decisions we make when trading. In section 3 I cover the elements of human emotion and explain how to recognize and disrupt rash behavior before it causes you to make impulsive or irrational decisions. I also introduce the building blocks of emotional intelligence
In section 4 I explain the key differences between conscious willpower and subconscious habits and outline how to bridge the mental gaps between the 2. And in section 5, I explain how you can take all of the content contained in the program and embed it subconsciously so that you can automatically implement it in your own trading
I’ll also show you how to develop a workable strategy that will drastically improve your performance, boost your win percentage, and set you on your way to consistent profit

578534,The Intelligent Investor,"If you want to learn how to be a professional value investor, this course is for you.  This course is not for the faint of heart.  There's a lot of material.  You don't need much by way of prior knowledge, but you do need to make a significant time commitment. You're first going to learn how to determine the level of quality of a business.  This requires a detailed understanding of financial statements, financial metrics, return measures, soft factors (management quality, composition of board, competitive advantage, etc.), and red flags.  And you won't just use this independently, you'll put them within a broader framework.  You're then going to learn how to value a business.  I will cover many valuation techniques.  That way you can apply the one that makes the most sense given the circumstances.  Ideally, you want a divergence between quality and price.  That is, you want to buy a company that is high quality at a fair price, or an average quality business at a below average price.  The idea is to always look for those mis-pricings.  But unless you know how to assess quality and how to come up with a correct valuation, you'll never learn how to find geniune mispricings.  Lastly, all throughout this course we're going to help you build a mental framework that helps you to make smart decisions when things get tough.  There is no specified time that this course will take.  I recommend viewing the content multiple times.

They simply understand how to read the tape. There is no secret sauce, but rather a technique that has been around since the market was founded. It is not a ""secret sauce"" or master powerful trading system, but just the basic understanding of how to read the time and sales.
Tape readingis the art of studying pure and magnified price action real time based on the Level II box. Using the tape you are able to gauge players psychology and imbalances in supply and demand. Reading the tape is a leading indicator, not like charts and indicators where they are based on past data. Tape reading is an important skill to master as an intraday trader because it allows you to see real time where there is buying and selling going on at level. This is also a very important skill because it will improve you efficiency, risk/reward ratio, and it will allow you to catch larger moves all while allowing you to take on the least amount of risk possible.
Tape reading is your edge and will put ahead of many other traders that think technical analysis is the only thing they should know. The advantages of reading the tape are that it brings consistency to your trading, it is a leading indicator, you are able to see buyers/sellers in real time, it minimizes your trading risk and it gets you in more plays that the charts don’t show you. Finally, reading the tape is about analysis the bid, offer, size, volume, and prints. With reading the tape you will be able to determine where the stock is going to move 90% of the time.
Sure, it might seem a bit confusing seeing all those numbers and colors running through your screen but it is not impossible. It is really the most basic, yet important, aspect of trading-after risk management.
Tape reading will help you see what buyers and sellers are doing in real time. It helps you understand what is happening in a chart pattern. It helps you see the chart pattern form in real time. All of this will help you get an understand of the supply and demand dynamics in the stock.... in which will mean more money in your pocket.
The Tape Reading 101 Course is an online educational course which is based on tape reading. It is taught in three different mediums-audio, video, and reading. First, you will read about a section on the the specific topic, then you will watch the presentation on it and after that take a quiz to test your retention of the material. By reinforcing the material three times per section, we will make sure you retain the material. This is done in four sections so you can grasp what Tape Reading is about. There are over 8 hours worth of video content and countless pages of written material for you to read. Best part of it all? You will gain access to the Tape Reading Archive database for continued practice ontape readingafter you finish the course.
To learn the ""secret skill"" that professional traders use on a day to day basis to make millions. Inside you will learn everything from what tape reading is, the level I & II, big bids, bid offers, how to execute your orders, held bids, held offers, and how to spot buy/sell programs.You will also be able to spot high frequency trading algorithms after the course.This alone will teach you theEDGEmarket professionals use in the markets day in and day out to steal money from the little guy.

Dear fellowAdvanced Forex Trader,
Don’t get mewrong. Iunderstandwhy you are trying to program your way through the Forex market.
Before we hadautomatedsystemsBruce Kovnermade himself and his hedge fund investors rich in Forex. Kovner cued ontradersentimentcombined with keysupportandresistancelevels as he explains in theNew York Times Bestsellingclassic book ”Market Wizards” byJack Schwager.
The book reports that Kovner made over$300 millionfor himself and his hedge fund way back in 1987 alone. And that “Two thousand dollars invested with Kovner in early 1987 would have been worth over $1,000,000 ten years later.”
Kovner explains in his interview with Schwager that he tries toknoweverything about the market to get an edge. He employed human personalassistantswho watched market monitors 24 hours for breakouts into new lows or highs.
Bruce Kovner further explains that parts oftechnical analysissuch as chart analysis are where it is at.
“Technical analysis tracks the past; it does not predict the future. You have to use your own intelligence to draw conclusion about what the past activity of some traders may say about the activity of other traders.”

546656,How to Trade Commodity and Financial Futures for a Living!,"Can $5,000 Grow into More Than $15 Million in Futures?
The Bestselling New York Times recognized financial classic “Market Wizards” Documents That Ed Seykota Did Just This [on page #158]!
SUBJECT:Introducing a Controlled Leverage Approach to Futures Risk!
Hello fellow Main Streetinvestor,
You Have To Be Thinking... There Must Be a Better Way?!
I can't tell you how many times I did themath.
I did it over and over again, because I just couldn't believe thenumbersthat kept popping up —68%, 150%, 233%, even 488% profits!
So I referred back to the traders I had studied who developed these strategies; men likeStanley KrollandEd Seykota. I wanted to makesurethat these numbers are right.
I concluded that if anything they were on thelowside.
Here's a fact: In all of my 23 years of investment experience, I have never seen moreflexiblepossibilities in not just wealth building but also risk management.
Thistraininghas it all — big hits, fast runs, crazy yields, and solid long-term vision.
Then again, you could alsoloseevery dime you put into the futures markets.
But here's thekicker: You only invest a very small amount of your money. And that isonlyafter you practice risk free in asimulated trading environmentI have prepared especially for you.
Discover how to make small tests likeoil wildcattersdo. Never risk more than a tenth of your trading capital to step firmly on the road tototal financial freedom.
The possibilities areendless.
You can earnsubstantialinvestment returns that over time can add up to millions of dollars — all the while knowing 90 percent of your money is safely tucked away in secure guaranteed investments of your choosing!
A Tale of Two Investors
Let me illustrate thetremendousmoney-making power of Bulletproof Futures Trading. I think you'll be amazed.
Two investors...
""Investor 1"" wants asaferetirement 23 years away. His $50,000savingsis stuffed in five percent yield tax-free bonds. With reinvestment this ultraconservativewill grow family savings $153,576.  That will happen when he is grey haired atsixty-five.  Not bad though don’t youagree?
""Investor 2"" wants security as well and buys five percentbonds. But, differently than ""Investor 1"", he puts 10 percent of his portfolio — $5,000 — in futures at a thirty-threepercentreturn.
When ""Investor 2"" stops working twenty-three years later the forty-fivethousandof tax free bonds is now $138,218. But the other at a thirty-three percent return is an eye-popping $3,528,236. Total take is $3,666,430.  That is twenty-fourtimesthe take of ""Investor 1!""
Let meadmitright here that there are a couple of things left out of this calculation.Taxes, for example. And of course, there's also theriskof loss that takes you back a few paces. Still, you get the point: a little bit of moneycarefullyinvested makes more profit than a lot of money at low rates of return.
Did you ever think as little as 10% of yourportfoliocould create that much wealth?
Itcan!
And thebestnews is, you don't have to ""bet the farm"" or risk most of your hard-earned savings to succeed. All it takes is a few thousand — or as little as 10 percent of your portfolio — and a couple of hours a month of your time.
Leverage: The Secret Weapon of the Mega-Wealthy
What is the underlyingsecretto the huge success of this Udemy course?
You learntechniquesfor leveraging and controlling risk developed by successful traders. Getting it right rains money. But duffing it here and they losses little when leverage is controlled.
Imagine going to thestoreand having the clerk tell you that you can buy $100 worth of goods for every dollar you have...
Usingother people’smoneygives you your check-mate moves in the game of controlled leverage futures trading.
Today's wealthyelitedidn't grow rich The posh families of London’sEast EndandBeverly Hillsdid not make it with the rule of buy low and sell high alone. Their ships cam in compounding with other people’s money.  They do this with foreign currency, petroleum,real estate, and anything else then can wangle.
This Udemy course puts these same powerfulleveragingtechniques at your fingertips, so you can make big-money moves without all of the risks typically associated with high leverage.
Minimum Risk — Unlimited Return
What kind of incomepotentialdoes futures offer using the futures trading strategies?
Thepotentialis enormous! Abeginner— inexperience could have turned a couple of grand into three in a matter of months. Another moreseasonedinvestor could have initiated 10 of the same option positions and turned a collected $30,000 profit in a mere five months!
You already know whathappenedto $5,000 with a 33% returns above in ""a tale of twoinvestors.""
I know what you arethinking, “what investment cranks out 33%?” Nowunderstand, that I would be a con artist if I guaranteed any of your returns.  And my advice is neverpersonal.
Honestly, with futures contracts loss is always a possibility.
That's whyamateurswho get into commodity trading frequently take huge losses. But the pros always limit their losses withdiscipline— only putting a small part of their portfolios at risk. Profit possibilities in futures trading are solargethat a few hits a year can fully reverse losses on small test trades.
Forexample,
How the Same Investment Can Cough Up 21 Times the Profit…
By following the principles of this Udemy course, you canmultiplythe power of every dollar you invest 20, 30, even 50 times over... and that means you can also multiply your profits.
There are four critical values that you have tocalculateevery time you invest in a futures option spread.

400464,Introducción al trading de opciones,"Durante años, las opciones se mantuvieron fuera del alcance de los inversionistas aficionados ya que se consideraban difíciles de entender o riesgosas.  La realidad y la experiencia de los inversionistas profesionales han demostrado que las opciones son instrumentos rentables, eficientes y estratégicos cuando se utilizan de manera adecuada.  Adicionalmente, permiten establecer un nivel de riesgo predeterminado para que el inversionista pueda calcular de antemano la cantidad de dinero que está dispuesto a arriesgar en el mercado.
El mundo del trading está lleno de ""gurús"" que pretenden convencer a los inversionistas aficionados sobre sus estrategias milagrosas y trucos para ganar dinero rápido.  En nuestra opinión profesional, invertir dinero en los mercados financieros es un asunto serio y es necesario educarse antes de invertir dinero en estrategias de trading que el inversionista no entiende.
Aprenda y domine los siguientes temas sobre opciones financieras en nuestro curso introductorio
·Conceptos fundamentales sobre las opciones.  Entienda que son el activo subyacente, la fecha de vencimiento, la prima y el strike price.
·Clasificación de las opciones.  Aprenda la diferencia entre opciones call, put, americana, europea, bermuda, plain vanilla, asiática, con barreras, lookback y binarias.
·¿Cómo se determina el valor de una opción? Entienda los factores que determinan el precio de una opción.
·Combinaciones de opciones o ""spreads"".  Aprenda cómo funcionan estas estrategias y utilícelas para inversión o cobertura.
·Cuenta de inversiones de práctica.  Siga los pasos para abrir una cuenta de inversiones donde se utiliza dinero ficticio para practicar todos los conceptos y estrategias en un ambiente libre de riesgo.
Existen muchos tipos diferentes de opciones financieras y cada una de ellas tiene características particulares.  Un inversionista educado es capaz de analizar cada estrategia de trading y evaluar los costos y beneficios asociados a ella.  De lo contrario, el inversionista está confiando en un sistema desarrollado por otra persona que puede tener objetivos y riesgos diferentes al suyo.
Este curso te ayudará a obtener los conocimientos necesarios para entender las estrategias de trading de opciones más comunes y te abrirá las puertas a cursos intermedios y avanzados de opciones y otros derivados financieros.  El curso está dirigido a todas las personas que quieren aprender qué son las opciones, para qué sirven, y cómo funcionan los mercados de opciones.

Una vez tengas claro cómo funcionan las opciones financieras, te enseñamos a utilizar combinaciones de opciones o ""spreads"" para que puedas predeterminar el nivel de riesgo de tus inversiones.

What Students Are Saying About This Course:
· ""I have used Adobe CC for a few years now, but everything I've learned I've learned from doing. While some of this has been basic as I'm already familiar with the tools, there are tricks and advice that I would have never known that make life MUCH easier (the ""content-aware"" fill is a game changer) and I really enjoy the pacing and manner in which he explains the tools, techniques and theory!"" - Nikki Tetreault
· ""This course is good. The tutor is really nice and clear (US accent is alien to me so I sometimes find it difficult to understand - the tutor here is great, doesn't speak too fast & is clear, without too many colloquialisms). Enjoying the classes. Feel prepared enough for the purpose I took the course. Would definitely recommend and also do other courses by this tutor"" - Alvira Kiss
· ""I started this course with little experience and thankfully I have learnt a lot throughout this course. I can't wait to learn more about this industry and make my mark on the world and its all thanks to this course which has kickstarted my journey!"" - Charles Vaughn
· ""So far it's been great. I'm a student that struggles largely in traditional school settings, the ability to pause, take notes, rewind, and move back and forth as I need has been great. The instructor has been clear and precise, and has given plenty to think about as we're creating files."" - Samantha Finn
· ""For a guy whove been working with photoshop for nearly 10 years Im still learning from this course."" - Aryne Neil Cabatan

What to Expect:
We will be using Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator; the industry-standard applications for graphic design.

If you aren't looking to learn design for a job, don't worry - this is a great course for you too!

As mentioned before, I cover a lot of program shortcuts in this course as well!

You can't do math without knowing how to count and you can't drive without knowing what the key looks like.
This course is your ""key"". All drawing starts with lines, some are straight, some are curved and rough but all are lines.  Lines are used to make shapes and shapes become volumes (3d shapes) and everything in the world is made from shapes.
I will teach you to use those shapes. I will show you how to make lines shapes and volumes. You will learn to hone your observational skills and draw what you see, and even what is in your head if you study and practice enough.
You need no experience in drawing. Absolutely zero ! There is no special software just a regular pencil and some paper.
If you have always wanted to learn to draw this is the course for you. If you are a graphic artist that knows learning to draw will save you time and money, take this course. If you want to make comics or cartoons then this will be the course that will be your starting point.

15611,Discover the 7 Secrets to Figure Drawing: Draw Awesome ...,"Discover the 7 Secrets of Figure Drawing:

Draw Awesome Figuresin Two Weeks

Ever feel so frustrated with your figure drawings you justwant to give up? Is it even hard to draw a cartoon?

You see other artists’ work and think, why can’t I draw myfigures like that? I used to feel the same way until I discovered the secretsof figure drawing, and I’m going to share them with you.

Tim thought he would never be a concept artist because his figuredrawings weren’t good enough, but then he found my 10 hour course, and guess what?He’s now a concept artist.

You too can draw the human figure like a master artist.

“I want to help Neil because he helped me. I owe my job tohim. His teaching techniques and teaching style made everything finally click.I just got it! I started drawing figures that looked good. What a greatfeeling. Even if I never landed my dream career, just the feeling of drawinggreat figures was worth every penny Neil charges. I can’t believe he offers somuch for so little.” – Tim.

Don’t give up on yourself. You can draw people, and youwon’t believe how little it will cost you.

You want to draw for a living, or paint for a living, butthe human figure is holding you back, but it doesn’t have to anymore. After yougo through 10 hours of video containing my step-by-step drawing lessons and mybest-kept secrets, you’ll draw the human figure like never before! Guaranteed.I mean that.

I can guarantee it because I’ve seen it work again and againfor my students.

You should see Kim’s before and after, but I don’t know howto post that here.

It worked for me. You should see how my figures used to look.I almost gave up!

Once the secrets of drawing the human figure clicked, I madequick leaps. Would you believe that before and after was only 30 days after Ifigured the secrets of figure drawing out? Yes. It’s true. It only takes sometwo weeks. I want to repeat that because it’s so awesome.

You can learn how to draw the human figure in two weeks!

What? Crazy, right? My students are evidence. I am evidence.I’ve seen it work for me and others.

You just have to watch the videos and do the exercises.That’s it.

You can have that dream job, drawing or painting.

You can make moneywith your art.

You can, you can, you can.

But you’ve tried art courses? You read some figure drawingbooks? You even paid for personal art lessons?

Why will my course be any different?

Because it is different. Why don’t figure drawing books tellyou how important it is to master the stick figure before you even startdrawing mannequins? Because not every artist is a great teacher. Most masterartists either don’t know or don’t remember what it takes to get to that level.

They don’t know how to break down the step-by-step learningprocess that is necessary for most people to draw the human figure like a pro.That is what this course does for you. It turns you into a figure drawing professional.

I guarantee you will finally be happy with your figuredrawings once you complete Master the Human Figure that I will give your moneyback if you aren’t. Of the 1,297 people that have bought the course so far, notone of them has complained. Not one.

But you won’t ever be able to draw the human figure?

If you can master the basic stick figure, you can draw thehuman figure.

It’s true.

Students have told me I should charge $500 for this 10 hourcourse Master the Human Figure. I don’t. I’m not even charging the normal $69dollars.

What am I charging then? You are probably ready to punch me.

But why? Why would I do that?

Because, I have no overhead, no electric bill to pay, nooffice rent, no CD’s to produce, etc. I offer you the 10 hours as instantstreaming video, with fast servers. You can even download them.

“I had spent a lot ofmoney previously on books and classes however what i have learned from bothyour Mastering the Human Figure and the Mastering the Human Head is incredible.What i enjoy most of your courses is that you break down the *Formulas*, and ireally enjoy the fact that you are always stressinsg the importance ofpractice, practice, practice. I went from being frustrated and stuck to excitedand motiviated. And thank you for making it soo affordable, THANK YOU...”–OrlandoPiedrahita, CA

Why should I over charge you? It only cost like $100 toproduce a new, flat-screen TV, and they sell them for $300 and up. I’m notgoing to do that to you. My conscience won’t allow it.

Why do my students believe I should charge $500?

Because you get 10 hours of video lessons. You watch over myshoulder as I draw and teach you as if you were right there with me. You aregetting 10 hours of personal teaching.

Just look at all thelessons.

In the fast-pacedworld of professional concept art, you must learn to draw quickly. This meansyou need to be able to draw the human figure from your mind, especially if youwant to be a comic artist. That’s exactly what these lessons will do for you. Withoutany reference, You will draw people in complex poses.

I just loved to draw, sketch and communicate my ideas this way, so as soon as I had my first computer I started studying really hard the most famousdesign softwares. After few years, despite the fact that I was mastering these tools, I could see that my works werealways missing somethingand I so I was gettingfrustrated: how comes that, even though I am studying so hard, I'm not improving the quality of my works? The answer was thatI forgot about something really important! Thebasic rules of graphic design!
Design, first of all, is all aboutcommunicationandpsychology! Fortunately for designers, there are solidrulesthat you can learn and afterwards, use them in order to communicate your idea in a more effective way! Of course, you have to study them!
So, how comes that many designers still avoid to acknowledge them? Simply because getting your hands on the paper (or on the keyboard) ismuch more fun! however, this without a basic idea will turn into frustration very much soon! It can be avoided. With this I can help you.
I produced thisquick coursefor people who can't wait to start producing their own artworks. Isummarizedallthe most important conceptsof design in a40 minutes. I couldn't be more concise!
Learning these basic concepts, will help you to have better results in your worksimmediately. They will also be a solid base for your further studies!
If you are like me, and you like to learn while havingfun, this course is just made for you!

Universities and colleges spend entire semesters teaching this single topic, and the goal of this course isNOTto condense every design theory out there into a quick course - that would be impossible.The goal of this course IS, however, to provide students with a solid baseline so that they can begin designing with confidence, and so that they have the tools and resources necessary to continue learning the theories and principles of graphic design on into the future.
At its core, graphic design is an art form, and art is always evolving. Design rules are often made to be broken, but a broad understanding of what actually makes a design pleasing to the eye is key to developing relevant, eye-catching, and on-trend design pieces.
As an added bonus, we have a private Facebook group with over 5600 students and counting, which is an awesome resource for you to take advantage of while you go through the course. The group is an excellent place to post projects, get insightful critiques, and network with other like-minded students and working professionals all over the world.

Now, why should you design mobile apps?
Today, advanced technology needs user friendly interfaces. Developers and non-technical folks want to make their applications more appealing and easy to use. There is a reason why so many people started to use Apple products, their design is their main product selling point. Going forward, people developing products need to make sure their users have that great experience.

This has been a growing trend recently where UI Designers in the US make upwards of $80,000 USD. With this course, I'll teach you the relevant tools to get your product designed well, build out your designer portfolio, and land that next job in design.
This course contains over 100 lectures and 10 hrs of content. It's designed for beginners to play with new software and get a grasp at the recent design trends. You’ll learn the tools and best practices needed to be a great designer. I also throw in bonus content on getting a designer job with techniques and sample emails.

The course follows a familiar structure where in each video I will teach the concepts followed by a challenge or practice question. If your goal is to become a better designer, you should understand design principles, other graphics softwares like Photoshop and build out a massive up-to-date portfolio. The course does go deep into understanding Sketch but you will need to get creative to build new UI experiences.
Environment Setup
This course aims to simulate a live in-person course as much as possible. After you finish each lecture, you should practice and try the solution on your own. You learn the best by practicing and doing.
Projects
At the end of each section, you will be asked to quizzes or be given a challenge. When you have finished a challenge you can then post it in the Udemy discussion board or your online portfolio.

Other than speed, the other focus of these methods is their  nondestructive quality, which allows the artist to go back into any stage or  section of the piece and easily change it. The course also covers how to  push the appeal of the character by employing gradients to add  dimension and interest, and using a combination of cell shading and painterly  techniques to get the most out of the character and ultimately produce a high  quality piece of character artwork.

You will learn to recognize and identify  specific faces among others, or even train your very own object detector  to use it for your own specific purposes.
""OpenCV Computer Vision Application Programming"" helps you get  started with the library by first learning how to install OpenCV  correctly on your system.

Reduce the distortion of your photographs and make straight lines of  the scene look straight instead of bent in your images.
You will learn to change the perspective of your images so that it  appears that you are moving around, similar to google street view  navigation and develop a 3D representation of a scene using stereoscopic  images.

563708,Bestseller!! Learn Illustrator CC in 1 Hour,"Adobe Illustrator is one of the most powerful vector-based programs in the world. It is the industry standard for creating beautiful logos, packaging design, artwork and more recently website layouts.
I have been using Illustrator for over 15 years and I designed this class to focus only on the specific things you need to learn to get up and running with Illustrator quickly. Within the first few classes you will already have what you need to open Illustrator and start working.
This isn't going to be one of those boring classes where we walk through every single tool and your mind starts to drift. There are plenty of classes out there that will show you every bell and whistle included with Illustrator. But let's be honest, nobody needs to know everything to be a professional graphic designer. Some of the most successful designers I know only use about 25% of the program's full potential. The key to becoming a graphic designer is to learn how to effectively use the tools to bring your vision to life.
Do I need to know how to draw to use Illustrator?
No! I am a mediocre artist at best. Of course it doesn't hurt to be able to draw, but most of the graphic designers I know are bad to terrible artists.
Some of the things we cover:
I know it is frustrating to try and learn a new program, and my goal is to show you exactly what you need. We won't waste time on tools and parts of Illustrator you don't really need to know. Just like Photoshop, Illustrator is a program that has added lots of new tools. But in the process of adding things, it has also held onto a lot of the older tools that are now obsolete (like the Pathfinder tool).

3. Properly use Shared Styles, Text Styles and Symbols

WHY SKETCH 3 and not ADOBE PHOTOSHOP or ILLUSTRATOR?
Sketch 3 is a modern and hyper successful vectorial app used by top designers at Google, Dropbox, Twitter, Facebook and many other famous tech companies and small startups. Sketch 3 has an high quality fast growing community of talented designers and as of now it is considered the best choice from top designers worldwide. While Photoshop and Illustrator are amazing tools, they was created for other purposes, and then used for UI and UX design. This makes them more complicated to learn and sometimes less effective (e.g. when exporting assets or when managing projects with lots of screens and assets). Whether you are completely new to app design or just want to switch from Adobe, Sketch 3 is probably the best app to learn at the moment.

575040,Typography From A to Z,"Typography is one of the oldest art forms in the world, and one that has remained important even through our move from the print to the digital age. This is because you don't need technical know-how master typography; instead, you need a keen eye for detail, a love of creating, and an appreciation of good design. If that sounds like you, then you've chosen the right course.
Your Typography Crash Course
Typography Fundamentals in a Flash
This course has been created for anyone who loves typography design; print designers, graphic and web designers, animators, sign writers, and many more. Whether you're a beginner or an intermediate, you'll pick up a comprehensive skillset through the 73 lectures and 6 hours of content that come with this course. You can use any publishing software to follow along with the instructor; Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign or just about anything else you have a basic understanding of.
Each section the course includes its own walkthrough exercises so that you can put the skills you have learned to practical use. You'll start off by learning all of the terminology regarding typography (tracking, leading, kerning) and font classifications, and then you'll examine concepts like how fonts impact a message, and how fonts are used in different media like advertising, web, print, logos, and so on. Finally, you will cover the essentials of digital publishing before concluding.
By the end of this course, you have both a theoretical and a literal understanding of typography, from how it is used to where it used to why it is used, and of course you'll gain a solid groundwork in the practical uses of typography too.
Tools Used
Adobe Illustrator:The standard software for graphics design, and where you will do the majority of your work. Create any kind of illustration or digital art your mind is capable of thinking up, with any kind of typeface effect too.

987865,Make Patterns in Illustrator,"Make Patterns in Illustrator - learn to use Illustrator by making useful designs
Are you ready to learn Illustrator? Do you want to increase your Illustrator knowledge? Do you want to expand your graphic design skills?
Great!
Welcome!
This course is for you. It's a fun and a practical way to learn Illustrator.
Here you'll ""learn by doing"" as you make a range of seamless repeating patterns. You can use these patterns for scrapbook papers, stock imagery, backgrounds and for your own projects. You could upload them to Spoonflower to make fabric and wallpaper, you can print them on book covers and mugs. There are literally hundreds of ways to make use of the patterns you'll make in this course and you'll be so proud when you say ""I made that"".
Who is your trainer?
Helen Bradley has taught thousands of students to use Illustrator and Photoshop. She doesn't fluff about and is focused on helping you learn to use Illustrator in a practical and smart way. Her workflows are carefully structured for maximum success and she explains everything so you know the 'why' as well as the 'how' of any process.
Helen has a huge commitment to her students' learning - she answers all student questions and often adds extra videos to a course to help students with questions that others might also benefit from learning from.
What will you learn?
When you complete this course, you'll:
-       be able to create a range of different types and styles of patterns in Illustrator
-       have extended your knowledge of Illustrator tools
-       have learned new tips and techniques that you can use every day
-       be able to confidently create pattern filled objects for a range of design and commercial uses
Do I hear you say ""...but I don't know how to use Illustrator (and frankly, I'm scared of it)""?
I understand!
I've been there.
Illustrator can be really scary to use when you first start out.
… but I've created a better way to learn Illustrator. One that makes it a lot less scary and a lot more fun.
You see, you'll learn to make patterns you can sell, give away on your blog, and use yourself. So you'll be making designs that you can do something with at the same time that you are learning Illustrator. There's no waiting! There's no hours of learning before you can get started doingsomething. In fact you can start today. Complete the first few lessons and you'll have your first patterns made!
Do I hear you say ""... but I hate the Pen tool!""?
I understand! Most people hate the pen tool. You are not alone!
… I believe that Illustrator is so much more than its (dreaded) Pen tool – so we'll use the pen tool only when we have to (which is practically never) and you'll see just how much you can achieve without it.
Do I hear you say ""... but I can't draw""?
No problem! If you can use a mouse you can complete this course.
Quite simply, you don't need to be able to draw. In fact many designers can't draw and yet they make fantastic designs and great products.
If youcandraw – great! If you can't draw – don't worry, you'll be able to do succeed in this course even if drawing isn't a skill you have mastered.
Are you ready to extend your Illustrator skills?
If you already know the basics of using Illustrator, taking this class will elevate your skills to a new level. You'll learn to use tools and techniques in a practical situation. No laboriously making shapes just to learn what the pathfinder tool does. No! In this class you'll learn the pathfinder because you need it, you'll draw shapes intrinsic to the pattern you are making - you'll be putting your skills to practical use from the first lecture. You'll reinforce your existing knowledge as you apply it to real world designs. And if we use tools you've never used before - great! You'll learn to use them fast and easily so you understand how you can put them to work in your daily workflow.
Do I hear you say ""Please don't waste my time""?
If there is one thing I hate it’s wasting time and you probably do too.
So, I don't say ""um"", I don't fluff about, I don't make mistakes, I know my stuff and I show you how to do things efficiently and effectively. I speed up the videos where appropriate so you don't get bored or distracted.
I'm 100% focused on helping you learn.
In short, I'll get straight to the point and I’ll maximize what you learn in every class.
Do I hear you say ""... but I can't afford the latest Illustrator version""?
Again, I understand. I teach thousands of students who can't afford the monthly Creative Cloud payment. If you're using practically any version of Illustrator you should be able to complete this class.
Where a pattern is made using the Pattern Make tool which was introduced in Illustrator CS6 (and which is in Illustrator CC), you willalwaysfind a second version of the class that teaches the same pattern in Illustrator CS5 and earlier. I won't let you down. I will teach you to make use of the tools you can afford.
So, provided you have a version of Illustrator that's less than 10 years old (from around CS3 onwards) you are good to go. I'll help you get the most out of it and you won't miss out on anything in this class.
Will I just learn to make patterns?
Well Yes, and No!
Yes, you'll learn to make patterns – lots of wonderful seamless repeating patterns. Each pattern has been chosen for a reason, there are the basic patterns like polka dots and stripes which are foundation patterns that everyone should know how to make. You'll learn to make checks and spirals because they teach different techniques, you'll make faux leopard skin and you'll make patterns from lines and geometric shapes.
But you'll also learn to use tools, like the Blob brush and the Wrinkle tool. You'll learn to make spirals and use the warp tools.
You'll learn techniques and tips for working everyday in Illustrator.
You'll learn to recolor your patterns. You'll fall in love with the recolor tool as you use it to explore wonderful color schemes for your art.
You'll get plenty of practice using Illustrator and you'll grow in confidence with every lecture.
How will I learn?
This course is made up 100% of video content. You'll watch my screen as I show you how each pattern is made. I'll explain what I am doing and why so you can learn as you watch.
In one lecture you'll make a pattern from lots of small objects. Because making those objects isn't an important part of the class, I'll give them to you so you can get to work straight away. That way you can focus on the pattern and not the bits that go to making it.
Join me...
I hope you will join me in this Illustrator class. I look forward to meeting you and I invite you to contact me if you have any questions as you work through the lectures.
cheers!

1275872,The Complete Adobe Spark Course,"In this course you will learn how to create fantastic, professional graphics for your social media accounts, quick and easy webpages to showcase your photos or portfolios, and amazing animated sales and marketing videos.
Well this course is for you! I will teach you everything you need to know to be able to produce all of your own designs, web portfolios, and animated videos, quickly and easily. Adobe Spark is amazing, and is much easier to learn than other expensive graphic design and video software. You can achieve excellent results, and because Adobe Spark is free to use, you cansave huge amounts of moneyon design outsourcing or software fees. I have used Adobe Spark for many design projects, and always come up with fantastic end results!
Check out the sales video for this course, I created the whole thing with Adobe Spark, and I’ll show you how you can do the same.
The course is split into three parts:
In Part 1, we will learn how to create social media posts within Adobe Spark, and I will teach you all of the core skills you will need to create amazing graphics. These key skills include:
Plus much more.
We will work on a project to complete a Facebook post, and then we’ll use one of Adobe Spark’s best features, Magic Resize, to adapt it for all other social media channels, including Twitter and Instagram.
I will also show you eight amazing websites I use to get professional stock photos for my projects, complete with commercial licenses to use in any project, all completely free. These resources alone can save you hundreds in stock photo fees. I will also show you the two websites I use to get stock video footage for my projects, again with all commercial licenses, and all completely free.
In Part 2, we will use Adobe Spark’s Page feature to produce a content-rich webpage. This is brilliant for showcasing photos, videos and portfolios, and can be used for anything from boutique shops highlighting their products, to people sharing their holiday photos. We’ll set up a page from scratch, and I’ll show you how all of the features work, so you can start using it for yourself straight away. There is no coding required, simply add elements with a single click.
Finally, in Part 3, we’ll go through what I consider to be the most amazing feature of Adobe Spark, and that’s creating animated videos. These are the kind of sales and marketing videos professional companies use all the time, with features such as animated text with slick movement of icons and pictures, all alongside narration and background music, just like the sales video I created for this course. I will show you how to create these videos quickly and easily, and we will work on a project that will showcase all of the amazing features you can use in your own videos.
By the end of the course you will have gained the skills to use Adobe Spark effectively, and you will be able to make professional, clickable and marketable graphics and videos for any projects you are working on.

Hey, I'm Ben. I've been creating cute little characters for as long as I can remember - and I absolutely love it. Over many years of trial and error, I've uncovered techniques that make it easier to draw cute cartoons. Now, I'm passing on those little secrets to help over 27,000 students pursue their passion of drawing cute 'kawaii' inspired (Japanese word for cute) characters of their own.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS..
Have you always wanted to draw cute cartoons?
Would you like to learn some simple techniques that artists use everyday?
Are you a graphic artist wanting to get back to basics?
Are you a traditional artist wanting to expand your skills?
Are you a coder or game designer wanting to dabble with your own characters?
Do you have kids that you'd like to teach?
Would you like to surprise your family and friends with a new skill?
Most students answerYESto at least one of these questions. For a lot of people,drawing is seen as a life skillthey wish they had - andyou can learn it right herein this easy to follow course.
YOU CAN GROW YOUR SKILL..
Whether you believe it or not, everyone has a basic level of artistic ability - I've seen it over and over again. All that separates you from the most skilful artists are these three simple things:
Practice
Someone to point you in the right direction
Passion to keep learning!
My goal is to help you in each of these areas. I want to show you what it takes to draw your own cartoons and you'll be amazed by how quickly you learn.
RISK FREE, HIGH QUALITY VIDEO LESSONS..
For the price of a few cups of coffee (coffee lover over here) you will receive high-definition video lessons showing you in detail how to draw cartoons. At completion you'll even receive a Certification of Completion, from Udemy. Give it a go, I'm confident you'll love it.
A LIFE LONG SKILL..
Few things in life are as heartwarming as giving friends or family a hand drawn card - something you put real effort into! It's a skill you'll use for your entire life.

337072,Bestseller! Learn Photoshop in 1 Hour (No Experience Needed),"Give me 1 Hour and I promise you will never be afraid of Photoshop again. In fact, you will see how fun it can be.
Why do so many people shake in fear at the thought of trying to learn Photoshop. I know it is a huge program, but the truth is you only ever end up using certain things. In this course I will show you exactly what use every day and leave out all of the fat.
Photoshop has been around for a long time. And while it is constantly innovating and making our lives easier, Adobe very rarely takes out the parts that don't work anymore. It's understandable. Many designers don't want to relearn the program every year. So Photoshop has become kind of like a hoarder. Full of a lot of junk that it just can't bring itself to throw away.
Another important thing to understand. Most online classes want to be thorough. They think they have to each you every single tool and effect and walk through step by boring step explaining how to use tools that nobody uses anymore.
Why is this course different?
I'm not here to teach you all of Photoshop. To be honest, I don't know anyone who knows everything you can do with Photoshop. The program updates so much that you can either work as a Graphic Designer, or spend all your time learning what's new.
If your goal is to become a graphic designer, this is a very good first step. If your goal is simply to open Photoshop documents and know where to go...this is also the course for you.
If you have been working with Photoshop for a while and want an advanced class...this isn't the course for you. However we do cover some topics that are considered advanced. I just consider them cool...or really good to know.
Give me just an hour and I swear you will never be afraid of Photoshop again!

After we get up to speed with Photoshop, it's time to learn how to make some dough!

I will show you some of my favorite techniques to find new clients.
We begin with a quick hour of training. Then, using the tools from the training I will show you a few key skills that I use to generate income. After that I will show you some ways to find clients. Here's one of the keys, you don't want to try and find jobs where everyone else is. So forget Elance and other job boards. I'll show you what actually works.
As I add more to this class the price will go up. So I recommend you get in early. Once you buy this class you will be in for life. So it could go well over a few hundred dollars, but you may have only paid $59.
In this course we will learn the following:

Good Class, gives a good overview of using Guide in MATLAB. Explanations are short and to the point. Does not give in-depth instruction. However, the class is very good at showing how to use the Guide in building MATLAB GUIs. If you are unfamiliar with the Guide at all, this is a good class. It will show you how to make GUIs using the Guide and how to work with the many different elements available in the Guide like tables, check boxes, drop down lists, etc.

""This is one of the best courses on Udemy""
""I found this course invaluable in my quest to master logo design and am now going on to the advanced training from Dawid, because I have the utmost confidence in his ability to teach on the subject and am looking forward to learning more from him and developing my skills further.""
Have you ever wanted to learn Illustrator and become a logo designer?
Have you ever stuck with your logo design project and couldn't finish it, because you didn't know how to achieve certain effect?
Or maybe you've started to learn Illustrator but stopped, 'cause you didn't see any results of your efforts?
Don't worry. It's not your fault.Many tutorials and courses out there don't really show you how to learn Adobe Illustrator effectively, that is in a practical and simple way, like a logo design.
I am like you: I've watched lots of tutorials and videos on Adobe Illustrator, but they were all missing something: they always left me with an “Ok, so what do I do now?"" kind of feeling.
That is why I've decided to put this course together for all of you who are struggling with Adobe Illustrator or simply want to start using it and want to do it practically – in a form of logo design.
Take a look at just a small bit of fascinating knowledge you'll get:
What you get is a unique occasion to finally learn Adobe Illustrator the right and practical way. Say good-bye to pointless clicking and wondering why some things work and others don't. Focus on what you love the most: designing and getting paid for it!
But if you are not interested in any of that, you don't want to learn Adobe Illustrator nor logo design fundamentals, you can just stop reading.
So You've never used Adobe Illustrator before? Great! It means you won't learn anything unnecessary, that other courses try to stuff in your head!
Struggling with Adobe Illustrator and wasting hours to just get things done? No worries. Discover hidden tricks and tips, that will unlock your creative potential!
Enroll in the course and enter the amazing world of design in Adobe Illustrator and start getting paid for doing what you love!
But it's almost never only about the content, right?
Have you ever felt so eager to learn, so interested in the topic, that you couldn't wait to start?
You were gnashing your teeth with excitement, but instead of a sensation of your jaw dropping in awe, your head was falling on your shoulder… because you were so bored you fell asleep.
Boring instructors are worse than boring topics! That's a proven fact!
So trust me, when I say this:
Let me make you feel special. Let me guide you through all the Adobe Illustrator fundamentals and build your confidence as a logo designer. All that matters to me is your success!
And, of course, your order is covered by out…
30-day 100% No Questions Asked, Money Back Guarantee!
Now you may think “Yeah, it all sounds great, but there is a bunch of courses on Adobe Illustrator out there"". You got a point there, so let me use the words of one of the greatest thinkers of all time, Confucius:
""Tell me, and I will forget.Show me, and I may remember.Involve me, and I will understand.""
And as true, and even as obvious, as it may sound, many courses out there fail in one, most important thing: they don't involve their students in the creation process.
That's why I want to involve you into putting all the skills and knowledge into practice. I want to take you by the hand and show you, what to do with all the unparalleled skills you'll get:
I vouch for this course. I wish I came across this kind of knowledge, when I was starting out as a designer.
But if, within the 30-day guarantee period, you are not convinced this course is going to make you a great Adobe Illustrator designer…
… simply ask Udemy for a refund, but I really doubt that you will have a reason for it.
You risk nothing.
It's up to you now.

561800,Intro to Adobe Illustrator,"Every professional designer who wants to be marketable MUST know Adobe Illustrator, the industry standard software for drawing icons, logos, and vector artwork. Vectors are the curves that you draw with Illustrator, and they can be enlarged many times over without loosing quality, unlike raster art, which uses pixels on a grid, and distorts if it gets too large. Illustrator's vector files can be exported to raster formats, like .jpg, .gif, or .png, for projects that need them, like websites. I'm Joseph Caserto, a graphic designer with over two decades of professional experience, and I've been creating vector artwork that whole time. In this course, I'll help you master the basics of drawing simple vector shapes. Once you've got those essentials down, we'll move on, and use them to help you learn more intermediate ones. You'll build a solid foundation, which you can use beyond the course, to develop your own projects that showcase your skills in this application that's critical to know if you're going to be competitive in the professional design world.

You have probably tried your hand at architecture-related design and to your surprise... you could not get them right no matter how much you tried!
I mean you are able to draw and design much more apparently complicated assignments, but somehow buildings elude you.
You do your best and draw buildings... but to yourself, your clients and whoever else counts they always come across like 'something is missing'...
The solution to this problem is very simple: ignore the popular culture of 'you can learn everything on a youtube video or regular tutorial from google'!
For drawing architecture you either need to get formal architectural education (which takes years, it costs a fortune and is usually vague and not results-related)... or you can invest in my stuff.
Listen, I have taught hundreds of students face to face, I know what you need before you realise you need it!
And most importantly I have been there so I can relate to your heartache and frustration...Myself, I started off from zero skills with arch drawing (you remember those children's drawings with a rectangle house with a square window - this is how my skills were when I learned drawing over twelve years ago)
Do you just want to take your skills to a new level and get the creative juices flowing?
Who Is This Course ForThis course is good for you only if you REALLY want to get your skills to the next level: you realised that you want to learn this stuff, you already imagine the positive impact learning all of this is going to have on your career and you are EAGER and ENTHUSIASTIC about bettering yourself.
If that is the case, welcome in the freehandarchitecture family! Let's get started with upgrading your skills to the stellar level and beyond!
This course is not for you if you think you know everything and the content presented here is easy and beginner-level for you. That is just a defence mechanism of your mind, and if you are 100% sure you think like that, then you are better off skipping this course altogether and sticking to whatever you already know!
I really mean it, if you aren't set on getting your architecture drawing to the next level or do not want to change you wicked ways, then there is no point in investing in this course.

After the initial design stage, topics like rough   posing of characters and rough thumbnailing of compositions will be covered.   After a large number of poses and thumbnails have been generated, we’ll be   combining our favourite thumbs into a final composition plan. This will be   blown up and used for our composition’s rough pass. After the rough, we’ll be   getting in-depth with final lineart, discussing how to use overlap and line   weight to suggest depth. After the final lines have been completed, we’ll be   finishing off our composition with a tonal pass to show atmospheric   perspective and basic lighting. Shadows and effects will complete the piece,   which can be left as is or taken further into colouring/painting stages.   Additional topics covered throughout the course will include basic anatomy,   the rule of thirds, making characters more appealing and believable by   considering personality and contrast, as well as some Photoshop tips and   tricks to make drawing easier, and an explanation of some basic formats and   ratios to use in compositions for film or sequential art.

Greg R – “Great fun course”
“I’ve been playing the guitar for many years now – mostly self taught. I wish I had this course in the beginning. If I had, I would have made quicker progress than I made on my own.
Even with the experience I do have, there are lessons in this course and steps in the free bonus guide that helped me learn to play my chords better and faster. They even help me “correct” some bad habits I picked up along the way.
The lessons on finger stretching exercises, practice tips, practice exercises, strumming tips, strumming patterns, and tips on improving my rhythm skills helped me the most.
Thanks Dan for offering this course.”
Larry Arsenault – “Excellent instruction!”
“I’ll get right to the point…If you want to become a better guitar player then buy this course! I have struggled with chord changes for years and lacked fluency in most of what I was able to play. I got so used to hearing those “pauses” and felt I just wasn’t fast enough.
What I have learned is that, it is not speed, but technique! The information in this course is fun to learn, fun to practice and you will get results.
They are simple, but very powerful!
He explains the most common mistakes that can hold you back or prevent you from being able to perform chord changes effectively and then gives a plethora of exercises you can use to overcome those mistakes. Wait until you see the section on capos…just brilliant.
A nice addition is the 38 page supplementary guide that you can print out and practice even when you are away from the computer.”
Overall, you will learn more in this course for less than you would spend for a professional lesson or two. There is so much information packed in this course you will want to view it several times. I think this course will appeal to beginners, intermediates and even seasoned players.
The video quality and sound is perfect. Very well taught, easy to understand and highly recommended!

Jazz piano is important because it is a significant and influential genre of music that has shaped the course of musical history. Jazz music, in general, emerged in the early 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States and quickly spread throughout the world, influencing other musical styles and cultures.
Piano has played a significant role in the development of jazz, with many of the most celebrated jazz musicians, including Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, and Herbie Hancock, being pianists. Jazz piano is characterized by its improvisational nature, complex harmonies, and syncopated rhythms. It often features intricate and challenging solos and requires a high level of technical proficiency.
Jazz piano has influenced and been influenced by many other genres of music, including classical, blues, and rock. It has also served as a source of inspiration for many other musicians and artists. Studying jazz piano can enhance a musician's technical ability and improvisational skills, as well as their understanding of music theory and composition.

What a GREAT course, this is awesome. A plus plus and more. Mike G did a tremendous job with curriculum, explaining things in detail, and production. This course is user friendly and a great value. Mike is an excellent educator & musician which is transparent throughout this course.
-Frank Russo
Great Curriculum Probably the best Introduction to drumming! This course has a very logical structure and is cleverly designed so that pseudo beginners like me or even complete beginners can profit and learn a lot from these lectures. Every lesson is build on the previous one or extends the previous to a further aspect of drumming. Almost every lesson has pdf file and some have audio clips with the material made even more accessible and to practice separately. Already in lesson 10 there are some improvisations possible with the fills and the variations and i enjoyed this very much. Lesson 13 gives an insight how to transfer the techniques and rudiments around the tom-toms. This freedom to play around almost enlightened me and motivated to practice even more. I do not want to rush through the lessons, so that i have enough pleasure still waiting for me... thank you very much, Mike - this is a great course!!! Almost through and i need to add, that this is the best course i have got from udemy - i am enthusiastic about this great course!!

760300,Blues Guitar Lessons - Volume 2 - Slow Blues Essentials,"In this series of lessons, taught by top UK session guitarist, Bobby Harrison, we’re going to be focusing on soloing over a slow blues.
You’ve probably heard this kind of playing if you’re familiar with songs such as ""Red House"",""Texas Flood"", ""How Blue Can You Get"", ""Be Careful With A Fool"", ""The Sky Is Crying”, “Five Long Years”…the list goes on.
Slow blues is an extremely expressive form of blues, since it allows for a lot of freedom in terms of phrasing and dynamics.
Since the blues is an improvisational form of music, it’s harder to teach than some other styles. For generations, blues musicians have picked up licks and soloing ideas from other players, so feel free to use the ideas presented here in your own solos. Eventually, like the generations of blues guitarists before you, you’ll make them your own.
As Bobby mentioned in Blues Guitar Lessons - Volume 1, in order to play blues, you need to be able to hear blues and in order to hear it, you need to listen to a lot of it. The ingredients are pretty straight forward in terms of the scales and chords used, but there’s so much more to this form of music in terms of feel, taste, phrasing and expression.
Again, put together a play list of your favourite blues songs and listen to it as often as you can to really internalise the style.",All Levels,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/blues-guitar-lessons-volume-2-slow-blues-essentials/,True

If you are looking for instruction on how to play traditional wooden flutes, please know that our course is intended solely for classical Western type flutes.

However, you can also learn a ton of important foundational flute elements from our Beginning Flute course. With that in mind, please proceed with caution.

104304,"Learn To Play The Piano Using Pop, R&B and Gospel Chords","I designed this course for singers, songwriters, and music producers who were tired of not being able to play the piano for themselves. To get you playing the piano fast, I start off by teaching you to play chords first. After you learn chords, we put the chords together to play chord progressions; chord progressions are what most songs are made of.
There are 3 (three) books provided in pdf form along with audio clips that support the video lessons. You watch the video(s) and then read the corresponding section of the book, you can also listen to audio clips of what you want to learn next. Watching just the videos, you will be able to play the piano, the books and audio clips are for those who want to learn more chords and progressions.
This is a self-paced course, it will take from a couple of weeks to a few months to finish. As with any instrument, you will have to practice to develop your ear for hearing and skill in playing the piano. The more you put into it, the more you get out of it.
The course is broken into 8 (eight) sections. You will go from the basics, including how to play chords, tricks to sounding professional and how to find the key of a song to playing advanced chords in a matter of weeks.

648628,Learn Fun Dreamy Piano Techniques # 2 - Play Silver Bells,"Silver Bells - Learn to Reharomonize Silver Bells with different arrangement to bring out the dreamy and cocktail sounds in this song!
_______________
Dreamy Piano music is a quiet, elegant musicthat uses chords & harmony from jazz and classical music.  This is the kind of music that is very relaxing and soothing for meditation or dining with family and beloved friends.
It’s the choice of chords that you choose to create the nostalgic atmosphere with sweet sounds.
When these chords are put together, it has a magical feel that is timeless and elegantly graceful.  This kind of music brings hope and pleasure to our lives.  After playing such music, one’s spirit feels lifted up in the journey. The musical path is one of delight and joy.

Silver Bells is a very special Christmas Song.Even though the melody of Silver Bells is very plain.  If you take a look at the music score of Silver Bells, you will be able to pick up some very unique features in this song.
One of the unique feature of the song is the ‘accidental’ notethat occurs in 2 places in Section A.  Think of the accidental note as a‘flat’rather than a ‘sharp’.
Once you think of that note as a ‘flat’, you will be able to create a verysmooth chromatic chord movementin that section to highlight the unique feature of this song.   And when you can figure out the great chromatic movement chord progression, you can put it into the Turn Around and in the Ending of the Song.
Another very Unique Feature of the songis that there are many empty measures in Section B.  Usually in empty measures, we can put in all kinds of runs and fills.
For “Silver Bells”, I refrain from putting in just any kind of runs and fills.   We can certainly fill up those empty measures with ballad style of playing, and many of the runs and fills I presented to you in White Christmas.
Silver Bells with its repeated melodic notes give us many opportunities to do Dreamy Echoes in the empty measures.  When we hear bells, we want to hear echoes.  I will demonstrate8 Different kinds of dreamy echoesfor you to learn how you too can create your own dreamy echoes.  You need to learn some improvisational skills.
In this course, I show you a 4 Level CHORD METHOD to produce Dreamy Music :
1.  How to Create Chord Progressions to Create Dreamy Music.
2.  There are 4 Different Levels of Chord Progressions you can create.
3.  I show you where to put in the Secondary Dominant Chords.
4. I show you how the Diminished 7 Chords can help you see the half step chord movement to the next chord.
5. I also show you my final arrangement after the 4 Different Levels are shown.
You will also learn the following 24 Dreamy Piano Techniques:
Dreamy Bell sounds – open sound
Interval of 6ths – Sweet Sound
Color Chords – Augmented +5
Whole Tone Scale Run – Ethereal Sound
Dreamy Major 7 Chords
Secondary Dominant Chords on the weak beat: C7 A7 D7
Dissonant Symmetrical Diminished 7 Chords – Bdim7, Ebdim7, Gdim7, Cdim7, Ddim7

670640,31 Day Guitar Challenge,"Welcome to the 31 Day Guitar Challenge! I created this course because I want to give away everything that I learned to other new guitarists. I will show you the path to take to overcome any challenge or obstacle that may come your way. When I first picked up my guitar, I wished I had someone that could point me in the right direction when I felt stuck and wasn't improving like I wanted to. I will show you basic chords, techniques, songs, and scales to grasp the basic concept, but I want you to use my successes and failures to help you grow exceptionally fast while learning to play the guitar.
Please follow all the directions in the introduction video and you will do GREAT. If you ever need anything, feel free to reach out to me. I love seeing new people learn how to play the guitar and made this course for that very reason.
When taking this course, watch (1) video per day and play the guitar (2) times per day. I know this may seem like a lot, but your success and progress will grow exponentially if you do so. If you try to play multiple videos in one day, you will easily get burned out within a couple weeks. So plan to set aside time to play twice a day. Remember, this course is only one month long. It will take dedication, but you can do it and it WILL be worth it in the end.
Good luck and happy playing!

By taking this course you will be able to play a tremendous number of popular songs. Chords that are rarely used in popular music but can be included, will be easy to learn due to the knowledge gained in this course.

His videos are chock-full of great stuff taking you through your chosen lesson step by patient step, and the group coaching sessions give you even more insight into the mysteries of, in my case, jazz piano.
I've been learning with him for just two months and I can't believe I'm hearing the sounds that are coming out of my piano now - and it's me playing it!
Thank you so much Willie!""

71912,Have Fun with Beginner Blues Piano,"Have you always wanted to be the life of the party, able to sit down at the piano and play fun, toe-tapping music for family and friends without needing to drag a lot of music books around or even needing to know how to read music?
If you've taken piano lessons before, have you ever been embarrassed because you couldn't just sit down and play, any time, any place, without needing music in front of you?
Playing the blues is a lot of fun!  And with a little time and effort, you too can impress your family and friends with the piano pieces you will learn – and even create – after going through this course.
In this course we will:
-look at 2 common variations of the 12 bar blues pattern;
-learn how that pattern translates to the keyboard; and
-learn several riffs, blues-y sounding chords and an ornament or two that will get you playing blues in no time.
Added to that will be a handful of simple patterns or grooves for the left hand and finally, instruction on how to put it all together.
By the time the course is completed, you will have the information you need to start creating your own simple blues pieces to play for your own enjoyment or to share with others.
Through the use of videos, you will be encouraged to play along as I demonstrate each piece a chunk at a time.  Key concepts or patterns found on the keyboard will be reinforced through  text documents so you have vital pieces of information to easily access during your practice time. While written music  will also be provided I strongly encourage you to learn the pieces as presented in the videos.   Of course if you don't already read music, that's fine too. Just prop up the music on your keyboard when you are playing and see how impressed family are friends are when they see what you can play!
As you are going through the course I will be available for questions, responding to them at least once a week if not sooner.
This course can be completed in as little as a month depending on amount of time put into practicing and prior experience.  If you have never played blues before, this course will give you a brief but detailed introduction into playing 12 bar blues.
Not sure you like blues? Even if you never played another blues piece again, after this course, you will find your hand independence has developed, you are more skilled at putting the hands together in different rhythms, and you have increased confidence in your improvisation abilities. All of these skill will improve your playing, whatever the style or genre.
What are you waiting for? Make your dreams of playing fun, energizing pieces (without even needing to be able to read music) now. You may never see a better deal than this.",All Levels,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/have-fun-with-beginner-blues-piano/,True

Weighing in at just under 50 lessons and taught by top UK session guitarist, Bobby Harrison, FretHub's Learning The Neck course is a valuable, in-depth study into mapping out the fretboard and unlocking the entire neck of the guitar.

Note-finding exercises and visualisation formulas are covered as well as the famous CAGED system. The CAGED system enables you to play any chord or scale by recalling just 5 shapes.

You can choose to study this module in its entirety or use it as reference material, dipping in and out while you continue to study the other lessons Frethub has available. Either way, this course will soon have you flying effortlessly all over the neck.
This course is essential viewing for anybody who really wants to gain a full understanding of how all the chords and shapes and scales relate to each-other.

this course is for you!
In
this course we will start by approaching the heel toe technique. A
technique that has been, in my opinion, underappreciated and
underused in the drumming world.

First, let’s shed some light
on several misconceptions that surround this technique, the ones
contributing to having it misinterpreted and, consequently, underused
and even ignored.

Then, we will learn the technique step by
step, details after details and I will present solutions to
potential problems.
After
that, we are going to step into the preliminary exercises section,
which will allow you to give the first steps with the above-mentioned
technique, whilst learning how to assimilate that in a
rhythmic-musical context.

In the following section, you will
learn how to blend that technique within a string of exercises based
on sixteenth notes. For each exercise we will learn 4 different
rhythms/grooves.

Then, we will move on to a section that
includes a very similar group of exercises, but whose foundation
consists of eighth note triplets.

Last but not least, we will
have the section which I believe is the favorite of many of you…
the rudiments section! In it you will learn to do those with double
bass drum and you will assimilate them in 4 rhythms/grooves, like in
the previous sections.

After all this you will be able to create
your own rhythms and even perform a double bass drum solo! You just
need to let your imagination and creativity flow!
These
are the materials which are included in this course:

some of the course’s sections, certain videos will be played in

Each day you learn a little more and can play more songs or play the ones you know better.    It can also be a difficult instrument to learn.     Many people stop learning because it takes so long to learn and it is difficult.
Let’s face it not everyone can afford aprivate tutoror even have the time for a regular time slot.      In particular playing solos or turnarounds is well out of the game for most beginners.     It’s not your fault; you just haven’t known what to learn.   You learned a few chords, you learned a few notes but which notes go with each chord or key is a mystery.
The answer is really quite easy.All you need to know is which notes fit with the key you are playing in. Then all you do is make up your solo or turnaround using those notes.   You do need to know which fingers to use and the notes will almost play themselves.     You probably cannot play the fiddly interesting bits, the turnarounds, the solos, and most important, cannot change key.
You may even be stuck and unable to move forward with your playing; it seems a chore, not a pleasure. learning  scales will rectify that.

A private tutor automatically teaches scales as they are so important.   Such teaching is not so readily available online.

He got so into Bodhran he bought an expensive tuneable drum from Marc and it works better than ever to this day.

Ben is an experienced teacher and uses his skills to get the message across to you in a clear and concise way.'

Check out what the others are saying about the course and come to see for yourself how much more efficient and exciting your violin journey could be:

""This was the first useful course on the violin I've seen on Udemy. Others were either too basic or too slow-going or not technical enough. But this one was awesome in that he goes over the proper form for holding the bow, good posture and holding the violin and does a very good job of building up fundamentals.""
""This course is perhaps the most useful I have seen for the violin. It is full of very specific and practical information that helps the student really understand the process.""
""Exercises are deceivingly simple but very effective.""
""This course covers the subject from scratch the instructor is as clear as possible and his knowledge and passion give me the excitement to learn and study and to bring it into my classroom for my students. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!""
""Wow, I love the technical depth that he's gone into, so far, for the violin's anatomy and how the human physiology affects playing the violin.""
""This Course is extremely thorough and helpful!! Would recommend it to anyone.""
""Great course, really enjoyed it! Excellent coverage of the fundamentals. I thought the step-by-step process of learning the songs at the end by doing them a small chunk at a time was a great process. Thank you so much for this course, I'm looking forward to your next level violin course!""
""The instructor is very clear in his explanations and is highly positive in his teaching approach which motivates me to practice the violin every day. His experience with this instrument is clearly visible in the way he gives attention to even the very small details. Overall, a great course for a beginner like me.""
""It helped open my eyes to how the violin works and how to hold the bow in a more comfortable way. I also learned new songs quicker than I usually do because of the clear teaching methods involved. I feel I am getting better at the violin already.""
""This a great course, very informative. With information not only about the violin, but anatomy as well. Amazing!""
""Blown away by how well he breaks down all the gazillion technicalities you need to keep in mind while playing. HIGHLY recommended.""

It's also so great that you can go back and watch them as often as you need to. You will not be disappointed!""

What youneedto take this course
VIOLIN AND A BOW
You can take the first module without an instrument, but for the rest, naturally, you need a violin and a bow. Your first instrument should be easy to play, don't worry so much about value and sound. Head to your local violin shop or get a cheap violin online. Don't make this a reason to postpone your violin dream.
MOTIVATION
Get your love for music to light up the day. Hear the sound of everything around you, feel the rhythm inside you, think about all the music you will be able to play and get going with the step-by-step lessons.
PRACTICE
The more you practice, the better you will play and the easier it will come along. Use every minute on hand to fiddle with the violin and you will discover that it can become your good friend very quickly.

What youdon't needto take this course
Violin and a bow
Yes, you read this right. You can start with the first module armed with a simple pencil. I have found that many times students develop stiff bow hold because at the beginning they are afraid of dropping the bow. They hold it tightly and this becomes a habit later on. Until you learn to secure the bow without a tight grip, we will be using a pencil. This way you will develop a light and flexible bow hold.
Any knowledge about the violin
You don't need any previous knowledge about the violin. We start from the very beginning. However, if you have some previous experience and feel that the course is moving too slowly for you, simply watch these parts in a faster speed of the video player. Or, my recommendation is always to review carefully the basics, as they come back again and again.
Note-reading skills
Even if you don't know how to read notation you will be able to learn and practice all the exercises and songs in the courses. The added bonus here is that while you practice the songs by ear, you will be learning the notation subconsciously, as it is included on the screen, pointing out to each note we play. You will see what I mean, it's pretty cool.

Stop wasting your precious time searching the Internet for more random instructional videos. You deserve a better teacher than a violinist who would simply show you where to put your fingers. Let me be a true coach for you and help you achieve great results in the least amount of time.",All Levels,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/learnviolin/,True

One of the massive hits from the early noughties, this song is one many forget the title to.
As soon as they hear the opening fingerpicked notes, it all comes back. To me that`s the sign of a great song, play the first few notes and everyone knows it!
Learn this simple classic and get crooning!

Scarborough Fair was a huge hit for these two folk pop legends and one that will go down in history as an important part of one of music most memorable gigs - the New York Central Park gig.
That night they played this amazing song and blew the whole city away.
Blow your audience away with your rendition of this distinctive and powerful classic.

Fast Car is a song close to my heart and I remember hearing it as a kid and really loving it back then.
Since teaching guitar,`Fast Car`has made its way to the top of my list as the first fingerpicking song that I teach most of my private students – if they like it of course!

The 2008 Academy Award winning song from the massive independent film `Once`.
This song, the winner for best original song category is so sweet and so pretty it will melt any of the days frustrations away.
It`s songs like this that make getting home from work and picking up the guitar so satisfying.
It is so powerful can and often does bring a lump in the throat of people when they play and listen to it.

This is a truly beautiful piece that you might not know the name of, but you will be sure to recognise. Even if you have somehow never heard it before, you instantly fall in love with it`s melancholic beauty.
It`s one of my favourite classical pieces to teach and listen to. For all its simplicity, the music is absolutely stunning.
It`s also a very impressive piece has been described as ""the sound of a waterfall"".

Everyone knows this. A rather simple but highly powerful song that you can learn in just minutes.
If you`re a singer, that`s a bonus but if not you have a cool intrumental that will be easy to learn.
Some of the chords you don`t even need to fret the strings for!

602450,6 Must Know Tricks to Successful Solos,"It's very hard to play an awesome solo without the proper 'phrasing'...
Imagine talking to someone who always spoke in the same tone, at the same pace and stopping at exactly the same spots. Would you believe anything they tell you?Probably not right? Because they don't sound genuine or even human.If you want your audience to feel something during your solo's, you're going to have to be believeable. To be believable your solo itself must have that extra “human element"" to it.That's where phrasing comes in.Problem is, most people have no idea what phrasing even is or how to begin finding their own “voice"" in their solos.
Most people try to “copy"" the style other guitarists.
While it's great to learn from the masters, what most people end up doing is trying to become something they're not.Not everyone can tap like Eddie Van Halen. If you try to force it, you'll only become a subpar copy…
Here's What YouCan Do
Steve Stine, Professor of Modern Guitar Studies at North Dakota State University, decided to take his more than 25 years of teaching and playing guitar to make a short course aimed specifically at teaching people how to build their own explosive solos in their own style and strengths.The outcome was this course...6 Secrets to Successful Soloswill get you building your own phrases and melodies and ultimately solos, starting from the ground up so don't worry if you've never played a solo before in your life.

175278,How to Design Your Own Guitar,"Why design your own guitar?
Designing your own guitar is fun and working through the design process is a great way to gain a better understanding of the instrument.
If you like guitars, this is a really interesting way to spend a few hours, but also a great starting point if you want to get a custom guitar made, or build your own.
You could just follow a pre-made plan but it is much more rewarding to design completely from scratch. You can let your imagination run wild as guitars can be virtually any shape.
A working drawing is essential if you intend to build the guitar and an invaluable way to communicate your ideas to your guitar maker should you decide to have it made for you.
Overall Aim
To begin with a blank sheet of paper and work through the entire design process, making vital decisions as you go. You will finish with a custom guitar drawing of your very own.
Step by Step
The course will guide you step by step through the guitar design process from the perspective of a professional builder.
The design will be a real working drawing of a guitar and the course is intended to give you the best possible chance of success if you do go ahead and build.
The guitar designed in this course will be made in the next course - Build Your Own First Guitar.
Over and over again
You will need only a few inexpensive items to complete your drawing. These along with the course material can be used over and over again as many times as you want until you find the perfect design!
How long will it take?
Drawing a shape for your guitar is the easy bit. Making sure all the important bits are in the right place and that it will actually work as a musical instrument requires a little work.
It will take a couple of hours to go through the process the first time as there is a lot of information to cover but once you have completed the course and understand the process will become easier and quicker.
Whats included
The course contains full instructions and a library of templates to create your own original guitar design and working drawing. It covers all aspects of designing a solid body electric guitar, including vital information on construction styles, wood, hardware, bridges, tuners, pickups , electrics and much more!
Library of templates
(downloadable PDF’s) are included for tracing, to aid in your drawing.
Pickups: single coil, humbucker, P90
Control Cavities and Layouts
Standard and Floyd Rose Trem
Headstocks and Tuner Locations
Neck joints: Bolt on, set neck and neck thru
Why I wrote it
There is much myth and confusion around the world of guitar design. This course aims to fix that and help to avoid many of the common mistakes made by the unwary.
Whats possible
These instructions cover only solid body electric guitars. Acoustic, semi-acoustic and archtop guitars have other aspects of the design like bracing which is beyond the scope of this book.
Left hand or right hand
Left handed designs can also be drawn using this method. Whenever you see this symbol LH read the note and it will tell you what to do, usually this will be simply turning the tracing over.",All Levels,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/how-to-design-your-own-guitar/,True

Guitarlessonscover many genres inside thismusical form of the blues. Blues guitar developed from theAfrican-Americancommunity & can be sad in theDeltastyle from thedeep South, or happy in thePiedmontragtime guitar style of playing which is evident in all forms of modernjazz, rhythm & blues.   	  	                    Between the two there are a group of acoustic blues guitar players who used many standardchord progressionsto play with a definite swing, sill usingblues notes, but a step up from the standardtwelve bar blues.
Learn Acoustic Blues GuitarIn The Old Style
Big Bill Broonzy and Brownie McGhee are two great examples of blues men who excelled at adaptingtraditional blues verses, usingshuffles, walking bassesand all the usual tricks but giving it that certain'groove';almost like rock and roll. The five lessons in this course take a look at just one of McGhee's songs - Livin With The Blues, and four of Broonzy's.
Guitar Lessons - Learning Blues The Right Way
If you can play one of Brownie's acoustic blues songs, you can just about play them all! Both men werecountry bluessingers originally, further developing what was basically the music of Africa evolving throughfield hollersandspirituals, particularly after theending of slavery. Their swinging style of blues became a firm favorite injuke joints,together withDelta bluesand the appealingPiedmont(ragtime blues.)
What You Will Learn in theseacoustic guitar lessons:
Broonzy's style was much broader and we take a look at several of his songs in some detail.
Both men use a fingerpicking style called 'monotonic bass', which means that the thumb strikes just one bass guitar string every beat, instead of alternating between two or three strings.
It's less complicated than alternating bassfingerstyle blues, but that's not to say the guitar sound produced isn't as rich or musical. Both men were very inventive in their treatment of the blues, and the bass action helped drive the music forward in a very definite and unique way.
Each lesson is between 20 mins and 30 mins long and provides everything you need to play the songs presented, including slow close up demos of both hands, tips on singing and printableguitar tabfiles.Acoustic blues lessonsin the swing style just got easy -learn blues guitar now!

365292,Play Sonny Terry style on Harmonica and dazzle your friends!,"If you ever wanted to learn to play the harmonica like Sonny Terry this new course is for you! Please enjoy the course and give it a review.
This course is all about learning to play in the style of Sonny Terry.
Many thanks to Wayne T. Helfrich for kind permission to use his pictures of Sonny Terry.
Each riff is written out for you with standard harmonica tab, onomatopoeic words, and standard western music notation.
You will find an mp3 included which has each riff played by me at full speed, half speed, and medium-speed to help you learn how to play it better.
If you do a couple of riffs a day this course will take a month to complete - or go for bust and do it in a weekend!
We start with learning 19 riffs that I wrote in Sonny's style as a preparation for you.
When you've done those follow through the sections and you may notice the challenge increases a little. Take it slowly and you will progress without too much pain!
This course is based on a book I wrote with Paul Lennon. I was recently teaching the whole book to a student in South Korea and enjoyed revisiting the original material we wrote and recorded in 2009 so much that I decided to make a Udemy course from it.
The whole book (30 pages) and audio (65 mp3 tracks) is included in this groundbreaking course a page at a time. The whole book and CD is also available if you message me.
A lot of people want to play the blues harp so if that's you come on in, you're in the right place.
I will hold your hand all the way through the videos with my 'infectious and humourous' (people tell me) style of teaching.  You will feel like I'm right with you in a one-to-one lesson showing exactly you how to do it, and encouraging to become confident and go it alone.
It's designed to be fun, friendly,  easy for anyone to learn - even non-musical people! It is designed to help you succeed and lead you on to the next in the series.
There are pdfs and mp3 downloads with many lectures so you can read the tablature and play along with the audio music written especially for learning harmonica.
Please be sure to visit the Questions area and Forum to interact with other students. It's a great way to learn more and helps you apply what the course gives you.

The CAGED Pentatonic System for Guitar - Level 3 (Soloing Over a I-IV-V Progression) is designed to expand on what you have learned in Level 1 & 2. The I-IV-V is a standard chord progression, but many players still have problems soloing over this progression. This course covers the concepts to soloing over the I-IV-V using an upbeat chicken pickin' groove. The CAGED Pentatonic (5x5x5) System is the virtual blueprint for utilizing the entire fretboard. If you are only using the standard pentatonic box pattern, you are only using 20% of the fretboard. The goal of this video course is to break you out of the box and get you looking at the fretboard in it's entirety.
This video course is the third course in this series. The CAGED Pentatonic System Level 3 builds off the topics covered in Level 1 & 2. So while it’s not necessary, it is recommended to start with Level 1 and add the concepts from Level 2 and tie it all together with Level 3. After working through all three volumes, you'll see the fretboard in a whole new light!

Scales are one of the major issues we going to discuss by playing 2 major scales and 1 minor scale, and explain why they are important for your development as a classical guitarist. We gonna take a look at 5 basic chord shapes that will help your left hand adapt and stretch your fingers, so the pieces we will play later will not be that hard on the left hand.
Then we going to switch our focus to the right hand, by learning the chord technique and how to play 2 or more notes at the same time. This section will be filled with exercises to make sure that you get the technique right, as this is what differentiates the classical guitarist from other types of guitar playing like electric and folk.
After that, we will be playing 3 of the most famous studies by famous classical guitar composers such as F. Carulli, Mateo Carcassi, and Mauro Giuliani that will take your playing to a whole new level.
Finally, at the end we will take a look at one of the most important techniques on guitar like Arpeggio, and play one of the most famous Flamenco pieces of all time: The Malaguena.
So, here is your chance to really play classical guitar. All the lessons are broken down into easy to follow steps. I will not leave a single note, or technique not fully explained.
If you've playing guitar for months or even years and struggling to take your playing to the next level, this course is definitely for you.

I have developed thisAmazing 2-5 Power Chord Reharmonization Methodto help you gain success to playing your favorite standards.
_________________________
2-5 Power Chordsare found in many standards and popular movie themes.  They make rich full sounds that will captivate your audience wanting more.
In this song ""Yesterday"", I show you how to take a tune from its basic harmony  ( I  IV  V7 )  to advanced sophisticated chords.
""Yesterday"" was composed by Paul McCartney during the Beattle's tour of France in 1964.  However, the song was not released until the summer of 1965.  Before it was released, the title was originally called 'Scrambled Eggs'  but later the Beattles wanted it to be a one word title and that's how ""Yesterday"" came into being.
First,we need to establish a harmonic foundation to the song with basic chords so that you understand how complex chords come into play.
I also put in a section on Easy Improvisation.  I show you different ways to improvise around the chord progressions so that you learn ""tone motion voice leading"".  Even when you don't play the actual melody of the song, you can hear the song in the background when you play the harmonic chord progressions. This is a good ear training program to help you play many standard and pop songs by EAR.
Learn 2-5 Powr Chord Rules & Chord Substitutions to""Yesterday Improvisation"".
In this song, I teach you how to use 2-5 Power chords to reharmonize the song from the harmonic basic chord foundation.

663810,Piano Runs & Fills #4: C6 Rolling Waves & Waterfall Runs,"
Piano Runs & Fills 4: C6 Dreamy Rolling Waves & Waterfall for Songs Ending
Do you want your piano playing to sound more like a professional?
Many beginners just end their song in a boring way. When they get to the end of the song, they just play a long tone in the empty measure. They do not know what to do with the long measure. Often times, the song sounds very abrupt when they come to an ending.
How would you like to create a dreamy ending so that your audience can sit back to flavor the ending of your performance?
Here's the Secret:One way to create a dreamy ending is create contrasting rolling and dancing sounds at the end of the song.  You want your audience to sit back to flavor your performance right to the end.  You are going to take them up to a climax with the rolling waves going up.  And just as when they think you are ending the song, you are going to start dancing with your fingers creating a waterfall dance coming down.

In this course, I will show you 2 Big piano techniques on Runs:
1.  Rolling Waves going up
2.  Dancing Waterfall coming down.
3. C6 Chord - 4 Tone Chord
4. Use C6 Inversion - E G B D with thumb on E
5.  Learn my 4T6 Magic Handshape for Fingers Rolling
6.  Use Left Hand Smart Fingering: L5 L3 L2
7. Coordinating Both Hand by Thinking Simply: L R L R L R
8. C6 Dancing Waterfall Run
9. Train Fingers to dance on staggered notes down 3 octaves
10. Creatively add Extension to Endings
11. Combine 2 techniques: C6 Rolling Waves + C6 Waterfall Run
12. Combine 3 techniques: C6 Rolling Waves + Chromatic Chord Movement + C6 Waterfall Run
Come on in and enroll in this course!

475914,Chugging - it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing!,"This is an excellent course that will be extremely useful for anybody from total beginners to intermediate players.
All you need is a C harmonica (10-hole diatonic is best) - and your OPEN ears!
Each video lecture is acompanied by mp3 playalong tracks and the written music with standard notation, harmonica tabs and the words to say.
It starts very easy and will challenge you as you go on - but you will manage it, nothing impossible!
The idea behind it is to play' Rhythm harmonica'. Part of the role of a harmonica player is to provide rhythmic backing and that is what this course is all about.
When I was learning trumpet and tabla I realised that speaking the rhythms is a very good way of creating interesting sounds and rhythmic textures.
It also became clear to me as I was trying to teach people how to play like Sonny Terry that using words was a good way for me to explain it and easy thing for people to understand.
'Chugging' is all about saying, or rather whispering, crazy percussive words into the harmonica like 'choo chacka choo'.  Just whisper Choo Chacka, Choo Chacka, Choo Chacka Chooooo into the harmonica and I think you will see what I mean, manage this well and enjoy the rhythm it produces.
You will also learn to play some train sounds.
Everybody likes to play a train whistle and here comes yours.
Exhale to prepare (not through the harmonica), grab holes four and five, breathe in, and articulate the word 'WOWW' as you do it.
As you breathe in try to 'chew' the sound by moving your tongue and jaw around a bit. Like 'wow wow wow'
Don't forget to pull the imaginary steam train whistle chord as you are coming round the mountain Casey Jones style.
It is starting small and simple but will get up to about 30 lectures. The advantage of getting it now is that it will have a low price and when the other lectures are added you will not have to pay any more! The more lectures it gets the higher the price will go.",All Levels,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/getchugging/,True

1132694,Introduction to Gypsy Jazz Guitar,"Learn the basic guitar skills that you  will need in order to play the fun and exciting style of Gypsy Jazz.
Build a strong foundation in Gypsy Jazz guitar with this tutorial for beginners!
Master the powerful Gypsy Jazz picking techniqueRaise your rhythm accompaniment prowessSharpen and expand your soloingFortify your horizontal fret board facilityPerfect and optimize your practice timePolish your approach to live performance
Get the most out of your guitar!
Have you ever wanted to get a liquid, ""electric"" feel and sound out of your acoustic guitar? Do you want to get the most power and sound out of your acoustic and make your notes sing with sustain?
Learning the fundamentals of Gypsy Jazz will put a powerful approach to guitar at your finger tips. Inspired by the legendary virtuoso Django Reinhardt, the Gypsy Jazz style is one of the most technically difficult and expressive ways to play the guitar.
Gypsy Jazz harkens back to the days before the electric guitar when players had to make their instruments ring out with great volume using only a pick and their hands. Since most of the tunes played in Gypsy Jazz were composed in the swing era, you will also gain profound insight into the fundamentals of twentieth century popular music.  We will start by learning how to play in the style of Django Reinhardt, and then use this foundation to develop your own, unique style of playing.

Content and Overview
The first part of the course is an introduction to the basics of accompaniment. Then we will explore single-note right hand technique and begin to lay the ground work for soloing.
We will cover a range of topics.
Technique: I will guide you through the unique rest-stroke picking technique employed by virtuoso guitarist Django Reinhardt and the top guitarists in the Gypsy Jazz genre.
Rhythm: Learn how to play your guitar like a drum. Bring out the swing and rhythm. This is useful for many different styles of guitar playing and isn't limited to Gypsy Jazz.
Soloing: Get deep into soloing through Jazz chord progressions. Get to know the nuts and bolts of Swing Guitar soloing in a way that will enhance your overall playing in other genres as well (Rock, Swing, Jazz, Bluegrass etc.)
Practice: Develop strong practice habits and techniques to help your playing get to new heights of competency.
Learn the whole guitar neck: Gypsy Jazz playing utilizes the entirety of the fretboard. Build an infrastructure that will enable your fingers to fly around the neck of the guitar with great  freedom.
Performance: Learn how and what to focus on when you perform so that you and your audience can have a more powerful music experience.
This course is not just for Gypsy Jazz guitarists!
Many of the facets we will explore in this course can be used to not only help you play in the style of Django, but will also benefit your competence in  almost every other plectrum based approach to guitar.  A solid foundation in Gypsy Jazz picking technique can enable you to achieve unmatched precision, speed, and tone that will increase the quality of your playing in Bluegrass, Rock, Pop, Modern Jazz, etc. Gypsy Jazz harmony will spice up your licks and phrases as well.
If you are coming from a Classical or Flamenco background, Gypsy Jazz is an easy gateway into learning how to play improvisational Jazz. Many of the Gypsy Jazz motifs, melodies, and it's  overall aesthetic have roots in both Classical and Flamenco guitar.
By end of this course, you will be armed with the basic accompaniment technique necessary to sit in on a Gypsy Jazz jam or gig. You will also become acquainted with the single note rest stroke picking technique. The third part of the course covers fundamentals of Gypsy Jazz soloing.

Here are some of the 5 star reviews the course has received:
""Alex is a master of the loose-wrist technique and in this video he shows the components of the technique very clearly and in great detail. The importance of this technique in playing Gypsy Jazz cannot be overstated: it is the technical foundation of the style.""- David Levitt

""This course is great! It gives you the basics to start strumming your Gypsy guitar style and If you are an intermediate student you can even envision some ideas for when you are ready for solos. It's well recommended!""- Arturo Moreno

""Really gives you the foundation you need to both play, and just asimportantly understand what Gypsy Jazz is, and how it's structured. Paceis quick enough to keep your attention without glossing over criticaldetails. Very well done overall.- Travis Rodgers

""Probably the most well made guitar course I've seen. He is VERY thorough in showing each technique and truly makes it enjoyable and simple to learn.

Over the period of this course, I will teach you how to master three essential modern fingerstyle techniques that will take your guitar playing, as well as yourself as an artist, to a whole new level!
Learn and Master the Three Essential Modern Fingerstyle Techniques in this Step-by-Step Guitar Course
Master Modern Percussive Fingerstyle and Play Like the Pros!
Well known guitarists utilize these fingerstyle techniques to make their songs sound more interesting to the audience. Besides being able to help you write more complex music, these techniques catch the eyes of your audience and make your songs sound more unique and appealing. In order to give you the optimal learning experience, I have carefully selected the exercises in this lesson to help you master these techniques. These lessons have been tested through workshops and private guitar instruction with my students before being recorded.
Contents and Overview
This course focuses on quality instead of quantity and it provides straight to the point guitar lessons. In total, you will get five comprehensive tutorials, ten step-by-step exercises and one song riff. After this course you will be able to utilize these newly discovered techniques in your own compositions to write more compelling tunes and spice up your playing style.
To start with, I will introduce my favorite percussive warm-up exercise which is a combination of left hand legato lines and right hand percussive hits. This exercise helps to prepare you for other techniques because you will learn how to get your hands to play completely independent of one another.
The main part of the course covers the three essential techniques: slap harmonics, body percussion and over-the-top playing. All of these are considered advanced techniques that requires the student to focus on each one individually in order to master them. Slap harmonics allow you to add exciting overtones that accentuate your playing. Body percussion on the other hand, introduces a completely new dimension to your music. By emulating a drum kit on your guitar, you are essentially playing two instruments simultaneously. Finally, with the tricky “Over-the-Top” style of playing, you will surely catch the attention of your audience.
At the end of the course, we will use all the techniques we’ve learned to play the riff of “Memories” - one of my most famous songs with over two million views on YouTube!",All Levels,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/3-fingerstyle-guitar-techniques-you-need-to-know/,False

Everyone starts somewhere, and this course is the first step for you!Hi, I am Amos, owner ofAmosdoll Musicon YouTube with over 400,000+ subscribers and over 100,000,000 view counts where I have played over 1000+ completely new songs by ear within the time frame of a year.Nowadays, you can find piano teachers everywhere (I swear there is a least 1 every street here in Australia),but very little amount of teachers can truly teach how to play any song by ear, let alone DO it for themselves.However, I am for one that""preach what I teach""as I can playANYcompletely new song that I haven't heard before by ear in modern day music ranging from video game songs, English/Chinese billboard songs, Kpop, movie soundtracks (and everything that you could think of) simply with my series of methods in LISTENING, and implementing melodic/harmonic/rhythmic improvisational techniques to learn ANY song within 10-20 minutes!Wouldn't you love to do that too?
Playing by ear doesn't just come instantly in a snap of the fingers (those is all lies if others promote you that).
Before learning how to do that, you are firstly required to understand the core foundations of music... (just like how you wouldn't learn how to do the 100m sprint before learning how to walk as a baby)
Because without these foundations, nothing would make sense in my other courses, and that is why many people guess and check the keys (which is the wrong way!!).
This""BEGINNERS""course provides ALL my tricks, foundation knowledge and essentials in music theory and form neededbeforeachieving all this awesome mastery.For people who arecompletely new to music, this course strongly secures all your foundations.For people whoknow a little knowledge already, this course fills in all the holes and gaps you are missing.So come and join the other1000 studentsfromover 70countries and take this musical journey with me!",Beginner Level,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/piano-from-zero-to-pro-beginner-essentials-to-play-by-ear-amosdoll/,True
372416,"Piano: Learn 48 chords in 1 hour,  and always remember how","There's a way to play any song you want on piano, without struggling for years to learn scales or read music..If you want to be playing songs almost straight away. This is the method for you
Years ago I stumbled upon an elegant solution to an age-old problem. How to get anyone to play songs on piano quickly, without them having to practice for years or read music. I've since developed and taught this simple easy system to over 18,000 beginners online. With rave reviews.

It's transformative, making a huge difference to people's lives

“I have been playing for about 30 mins a day for about 7 days after following about 70% of the course. I have just finished playing chorus and verse of Sam Smith's ""Stay with me"", both hands! I'm a complete beginner and I have wanted to play an instrument all of my life. There was a moment, brief but a moment, where I wasn't thinking about where my hands were but just enjoying playing the piano. It ranks alongside holding a proper conversation in a foreign language. I can' t recommend this course enough it's short, easy to follow and it's inspired me on to a more complex course. Thank you for sharing your method and not wrapping it unnecessarily in a 20-hour course. Fantastic.”

Or this one

“It's so silly they don't teach piano like this from the start. I can't believe that it took me 2 music teachers and 1 year of frustration before I found someone who could just EXPLAIN IT.”

Why Listen to me?
As a professional musician I’ve had 4 record contracts, played all over the world, recorded albums, videos, and played main stages at many of the big festivals. I’m also an educator. I set up a successful non-profit teaching underserved youth how to create music quickly and easily. As part of that journey, I did a MEd Degree in Education at Cambridge University, learning the latest teaching theory. All of that means I’ve fused years of experience with the latest theory and built online courses, specialising in getting people playing as quickly as possible without being put off, bored or confused by theory. These have now been taken by over 18,000 students, with rave reviews. I know how to structure complicated ideas easily and explain them in a way that means people grasp them fast, and in a fun way without the B.S. that so often surrounds music education.

Confused or frustrated by traditional ways of being taught piano? Want to jump to the fun bit, playing songs?

In minutes you'll be able to name all the notes on the piano (even if you think your memory is rubbish)
In another 5 minutes you'll have learned your first chords and more importantly, internalised the simple shapes that mean you'll be able to memorise how to play all the different types of chords
Most songs only use four or five chords, Ten minutes in you'll know how to play fourteen. In an hour you'll know instantly how to play 100s using this system
I'll also show you where to look to find the information you need to play the songs you want to (what chords and when and how to play them).
I'll break down how to learn those songs, so you are having as much fun as you can as you learn piano as quickly as possible. learning through fun is massively more effective than learning by rote.
There will also be a whole bunch of tricks that make you sound great, easily and simply without having to read a dot of music - No confusing notation needed
And much much more

This course is meant as an introduction to walking bass. We won’t be going into any complicated theory and walking bass concepts. What you’ll gain are necessary foundations for expanding your knowledge and more importantly - means of cheating your way into walking bass territory. After all, not all of us end up being session musicians or super stars in certain genres. All musicians (even pros), often prefer to take the easy route and learn how to “fake” certain styles. This is what you’ll learn, you’ll learn how to “fake” walking bass type of lines until you are ready for more. I must say, that this can be a lot of fun and a lot of my friends (myself included), never actually feel the need later on to learn specific styles in more depth.
This course, does not rely on any music theory (at least complicated one). This is a problem of many other walking bass courses as those just dig too deep into music theory that it becomes boring. You’ll just need to have a very basic understanding of how to find certain notes on the fretboard (in basic, most often used positions on the neck). Since walking bass heavly relies on chords, you’ll need to have a basic understanding of chords and root notes, but we cover those topics within the course.

To be able to fully appreciate the significance of this unorthodox and original system, one has to personally get involved in the program. This is hands-on training, no holds barred, as if a real teacher was sitting there next to you. You will not be doing anything you’re not capable of. Except, of course, if you’ve got no hands or maybe fewer than ten fingers!But since that’s highly unlikely, you will very soon be playing the piano the way you really want yourself to sound, not just like what music books tell you to do.To be able to achieve this, a different set of steps are to be taken in this course, steps that would at first seem ridiculous, but which would later yield results that are more deep-seated and lasting.You will find it to your advantage to follow the course meticulously, knowing that every lecture is an advancement towards your development as a true musician.So then, what is Pianish? It’s a language, just like English and Spanish. It’s the language a pianist uses to communicate. And it’s what this whole course is all about.Have a go and see how, after all, it’s so easy to speak Pianish!",Beginner Level,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/pianish101/,True

You will pick it up straight away without needing any music skills. This is easy to play and really fun to learn. You will be proud of your achievements and happy with the results.
'INSTANT HARMONICA' is a new series of courses where you learn one tune per course. You will find it is taught in a friendly and encouraging manner and most importantly is it taught v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y.
Ben Hewlett is a very experienced music teacher who is able to be very patient and methodical. Each lecture will introduce you to the next group of notes – usually just 4 new notes and that's it.
This method is very easy for you to pick up the tunes as they are repeated over and over again until you have got it. You can even re-run the video if you find it useful.
Take one course and learn your favourite tune. The try another. Remember you can always get your money back if you wish but otherwise you have lifetime access to the course.
Imagine how amazing it will feel when you whip out your harmonica and play this tune – your friends and family will carry you shoulder high in triumph. Hopefully they don't carry you out of town and dump you in the river, but hey, swimming's good as well.
The health benefits of playing the harmonica are well documented – google it. Your lungs get exercised, your lung capacity increases, aerobic movement is good for you, playing music makes you smarter they say.

""This course walks you through playing simple songs, but they actually sound like the real thing which gave me a sense of accomplishment and encouraged me to keep playing. I highly recommend this course!""- Helenmary Cody
This course will teach you good piano technique by getting you to play real pieces of music. In it, I'll show you how to play the following pieces:
the riff to John Lennon's ""Imagine"" - When the Saints - Happy Birthday hands together - Amazing Grace hands together - the opening of Pachelbel's ""Canon"" - the bass line and chords of Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean""
And at the same time I'll teach you the following fundamentals:
which way is up on a piano - good practice technique - the finger numbers - playing in time - the note names - good hand position - how to play ""legato"" (and what that means) - phrasing - what an ""octave"" is - coordinating your 2 hands - how to play with a metronome - the right way to play chords
So why this beginner piano course instead of any other one?
1) It doesn't teach you how to play the piano by teaching you how to read music first
Almost all beginner piano courses teach you how to read music first and then get you to play from a score, but that's backwards - after all, you didn't learn to read before you could speak! Reading music is difficult, and if you try to learn how to play piano while learning how to read music at the same time you'll end up doing both badly. Instead, there's a body of research that shows that getting people to play first andthenshowing them how to read music is better (the approach is called ""Sound before Sign""). This is the approach I use in this course. (I have a separate course which teaches you how to read music, called ""Read Music FAST!"", which you should do after this one.)
2) I have aridiculousamount of experience teaching music using videos
I've been teaching piano one-on-one for over 10 years, to children and adult beginners as well as industry professionals, and I record practice videos for all of my students. At the time of writing I have over4,000private videos on YouTube, and so know exactly how to pace videos so that they're not so fast you can't follow them, but not so slow you get bored and stop either.
3) You'll develop good habits which will save you a ton of time in the future
A lot of beginner piano tutorials are designed to get you to play a piece as fast as possible, which is a good aim in itself (mine do the same), but they'll usually teach you bad habits at the same time, which you'll then have to spend a lot of time unlearning in the future. By contrast, I'll get you to play pieces as fast as possible but also make sure that you're developing good habits in the process so that there's no limit to how good you can get.",Beginner Level,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/beginner-piano/,True

""""The Way We Were"" is the theme song written for the popular movie in 1973.  This song was written by Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman and performed by Barbara Streisand. It won the Academy Award and ranked no. 8 in the AFI's list of Top 100 Songs.
First,we need to establish a harmonic foundation to the song with basic chords so that you understand how complex chords come into play.
I also put in a section on Easy Improvisation.  I show you different ways to improvise around the chord progressions so that you learn ""tone motion voice leading"".  Even when you don't play the actual melody of the song, you can hear the song in the background when you play the harmonic chord progressions. This is a good ear training program to help you play many standard and pop songs by EAR.
Learn 2-5 Powr Chord Rules & Chord Substitutions to""The Way We Were Improvisation"".
In this song, I teach you how to use 2-5 Power chords to reharmonize the song from the harmonic basic chord foundation.
In the full arrangement, you will be playing these chords:

384928,101 Blues riffs - learn how the harmonica superstars do it,"*updated March 2022*  Udemy's BEST SELLING BLUES harmonica course - with over 4,500 students.
No harmonica experience? No problem, I'll walk you through nice and slow.

Do you ever feel you play the same stuff on your harmonica over and over?
I've felt that at times and, to get my mojo back, I study other players - and now you can as well.You need 101 Blues Riffs - and here they come!
We've broken them down so you get all the notes, all the tab and I'll even play them for you at three different speeds.
This course will increase your musical vocabulary; it will teach you how to play simple riffs in the styles of De Ford Bailey, Sonny Terry, Little Walter, Sonnyboy Williamson 2, William Clarke, JJ Milteau, Brendan Power, Big Walter, Charlie McCoy, Charlie Musselwhite and more...By learning these riffs you will be a much broader musician and able to impress your audience and bandmates.Every riff is written down as harmonica tab and normal music notation on a pdf and I'll play it for you at different speeds with a click track as well on an mp3.All you need is a 'C' diatonic harmonica and you're away!I'll walk you through every riff in order before moving on to the next one.If you want to free up your playing and explore the styles of some of the most successful blues harp players you've come to the right place!

Did you ever fool around with a harmonica as a kid?
Would you like to learn to play the harmonica better now?
Do you play guitar, piano, ukulele or are you a singer and want to add harmonica into your act?
Do you want an instrument that's easy to pick up, store and carry?
Did you inherit a harmonica and want to pay respect to the original owner??
Where you inspired by Bob Dylan, Sonny Terry, Little Walter, Mick Jagger?
Would you like to play in a church, campfire, band or jam session?
Do you think harmonica will help with COPD or other health issues?
Is this a retirement 'bucket-list' project?

If you answered yes to any of those who are in the right place.
This course will help you become a great harmonica player. All you need to do is follow the lectures in order plus some practice and you will start to feel a surge of confidence as you see your skills increasing daily.
This will be exciting, fun, and challenging – I think you will thoroughly enjoy it!
I think people recognise my passion for the harmonica. I’m not someone who plays bass, guitar, piano, drums and sings, records, gigs…I just (mostly) teach harmonica.
Sure I perform sometimes, gig with friends, go to jams, do corporate harp demonstrations but MOSTLY I focus on playing, learning and teaching harmonica.
So if you have a Hohner harmonica, a blues harmonica, hohner special 20, a chromatic harmonica (ok, not that one) a blues harp, a hohner big river, a harmonica holder, a harmonica set…you can start to play now.
Give me a shout if you need any help please.

I am an award-winning GIT grad, a 15+ year professional guitarist with 70k+ students, and the founder of Guitargate - sponsored by Paul Reed Smith Guitars.
""This course will teach you how to master your fretboard, understand music theory, and most importantly, how to use these tools to craft your own unique sound.""
*Watch lecture one (free preview) for a course introduction video
This course is a four part, interactive, step-by-step, all HD video course which teaches you everything you need to play with complete confidence and control in any genre of music!
Professional players don't ""hunt and peck"" or play without a plan. If you're getting paid to do studio work, tour with a working band, or even just play out in you local town,you need to know your instrument front and back, and know how to sound like you. This course is designed to give you exactly that.
Get beyond tabs. Get beyond memorizing note for note. Learn how to improvise and play with ease around the fretboard!
No tricks or gimmicks! If you follow the course and work hard, you will feel confident playing in any genre, over any changes, with anyone, anywhere, and be able to put your own personality into the music! It's really not that difficult if you try!
For the price of one month of private guitar lessons, you can have unlimited lifetime access to a world class guitar curriculum withreal individual feedback from a professional instructor!
Lectures feature all HD videos with multiple camera angles (so you can easily see the neck), downloadable fretboard diagrams, custom jam tracks to play along with, and detailed lesson text. If you post a question or a video link in the discussion forum, I will personally respond with real individual feedback! I try to check it daily.
No matter where you are in your playing, this course will fill in the ""gaps"" and break down the neck and music theory in a simple, and most importantly, applicable way.
While this course is geared to players with at least 6 months of experience, you will go from the very beginning to playing over complex non-diatonic changesleaving no stone unturned.  There isn't a more comprehensive course available anywhere.
After completing this course, if you wanted, you will have the tools to be a working professional guitarist... Or, you could just be a great guitar player and have a TON of fun.  Either way, I personally GUARANTEE you won't find another course as streamlined, simple, and effective as this one.  I've spent my whole professional life crafting this unique approach to the guitar, and I stand by it 100%.
The success I've had with my students has been nothing short of outstanding! Check out these student testimonials:
Gerard Bellini - ""I attended Berklee online. Although they hit all the topics, you are the glue that puts it all together. My hat is off to you. Thanks!""

Graham Baughman - Louisville, KY  - ""Having played for 20+ years, all blues stuff, I am glad to finally learn the neck. Thanks for building a great way to learn! There is no other web site like yours! Thanks!""
Jim Ferrie - Shrewsbury, England   - ""I've been playing guitar for 45 years and your lessons and style of teaching is second to none. It is my most important find in my quest to learn guitar! I have never been more motivated to learn!""
Chris Reynolds - Hertford, England, UK  - ""I've been self taught for 12 years mostly by tabs and songs. I haven't seen theory explained in a way that makes so much sense, and I've spent many years looking!!""
Ryan Endersby - Fredericksburg, VA  - ""I have improved my ability ten fold. I finally feel comfortable on the fretboard and having individual feedback is AMAZING! You will learn your instrument!""
JC Senatore - Blacksburg, VA  - ""In 2 months, I've gotten better than I have in the past 2 years. No joke.""
Tristan Johnson - Concord, CA  - ""I love the site, and it provides anexcellentvalue. After a decade of strumming and learning a lick here and there, my playing is blossoming and I'm inspired in a way I don't think I've ever been!""
Donnie Eastman - Atlantic City, NJ  - ""I've had lessons for years and never understood theory and modes. In five minutes I felt that “ah-ha"" moment!  Awesome!""

“I took private guitar lessons for about a year, but I feel like I've progressed further in the first 10-15 lessons of this online course over the course of a couple of weeks than I did with my in-person teacher. Henry does a really good job of helping beginners ""feel"" their way around a song so that they can apply it to other songs on their own, without feeling ""robotic."" The pace of the course is perfect and I finish each lesson wanting to practice and apply what I've learned. In addition, I appreciate the number of lessons he's dedicated to strumming, as that is an area I've really struggled in. Overall, a really good course, thanks!” -Jane

Start first with the Essential Theory and Technique course-
ESSENTIAL THEORY AND TECHNIQUE
The Essential Theory and Technique for Guitar course designed for two main types of people; the beginner guitar player who has no guitar or musical experience and those who can play guitar a little bit but are wanting to understand the music theory behind what they are playing and to improve on their technique.
Music Is A Language
Learning music is like learning a language. Music notes are like letters of the alphabet. When you learn how to combine them, you can create chords, which are like words, and with words you can create sentences and tell stories.
There are some great guitar players who don’t necessarily know all of the theory behind what they are playing, but using the above analogy of music as a language, imagine the potential that is being missed out on by not fully understanding what you are playing. If you were taking a trip to France, you could buy a translation book that could tell you how to say certain phrases in French, such as “Where is the bathroom?” or “What time is it?”, but imagine how much more you could communicate if you were able to construct your own sentences and phrases in French? You could say whatever you wanted without limits. Music is similar; by understanding the“why”, and practicing the“how”you reduce the limitations and open up a world of opportunity to express yourself with your instrument.
The course includes a full color PDF E-Book which is over 50 pages and provides further explanation of the material in the videos as well as guitar neck diagrams for your reference.
This course is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and should provide you with weeks worth of material to work on.
The topics you will learn in this course include;
Part 1: Parts of the Guitar
Part 2: The Musical Alphabet
Part 3: Notes on the Neck
Part 4: Neck Diagrams
Part 5: Holding the Guitar
Part 6: Holding the Pick
Part 7: Picking the Strings

KICKSTARTER: LEVEL ONE
The Studio 33 Guitar Lessons Kickstarter course is designed to start at the beginner level and progress up to intermediate. This series not only teaches you “how” to play, but also focuses on the “why”. We won’t just tell you to “put your fingers here” to play this chord, we want you to really understand why certain notes work together, while others don’t. Because once you understand how scales work, and how chords are made, it will unlock the mystery of music theory and really open up the guitar neck so you can play beyond the basics.
Kickstarter Level One is over 2 and a half hours long and picks up right where the Essential Theory and Technique course left off.

902474,CAGED Pentatonic System for Guitar - Level 1,"The CAGED Pentatonic Soloing System is designed to break you out of that box pattern that we all learned when we first started to play guitar. It's the virtual blueprint for utilizing the entire fretboard. If you are only using the standard pentatonic box pattern, you are only using 20% of the fretboard.
The goal of this course is to break you out of the single pentatonic box and get you using 5 different pentatonic shapes that utilize the entire fretboard.
Pentatonic scales are a great place to start because it's the first scale most guitar players learn, and it's one that we use the most.

You'll Learn:5 Positions of the Major Scale5 Positions of the Major Pentatonic Scale5 Movable Chord ShapesTriads ShapesChromatic NotesChord & Scale FormulasLanding/Target NotesInterval MatrixPractice LogsTABsand much more!!!!!
It's better to have some sort of soloing system versus having no system at all. This system is the method I use to create phrases, licks and solos. This method can really open up the way you view the fretboard of the guitar. This course shows you how-to connect chord shapes and scale patterns to take advantage of the entire fretboad. It's like connecting the dotes.
This course come with an MP3 Jam Track as well as, TABs, Chord & Scale Formulas, Interval Matrix, 5 Movable Chord Shapes, the 5 Major Scale Patterns, the 5 Major Pentatonic Scale Patterns, Extended Scale Pattern and Practice Log.
This course is 1 hour & 42 minutes in length.11 Sections with 35 Lectures,

help you master the entire fretboard.

920194,CAGED Pentatonic System for Guitar - Level 2,"CAGED Pentatonic System For Guitar: Level 2
Break out of the box…View the fretboard in it's entirety.
The CAGED Pentatonic System for Guitar Level 2  is designed to expand on what you’ve learned in the Level 1 course. This Level 2 course is based around the relative minor key. The Relative Minor has a Blues Rock tonality that adds an aggressive edgier sound to your playing. The Caged Pentatonic (5x5x5) System is the virtual building blocks for utilizing the entire fretboard.
When you see guitarists play up and down the neck effortlessly, it’s no secret that they're using some sort of system to connect different scales on the fretboard. So it’s best to have some sort of system to use as a framework for creating solos. Let’s face it, if you’re only using the standard pentatonic box pattern, you’re only utilizing 20% of the fretboard. The goal of this video course is to break you out of the standard pentatonic box and get you using 5 different pentatonic boxes that cover the entire fretboard, giving you more options when creating your own licks and solos.
Level 2 builds off the topics covered in Level 1. While it’s not necessary that you start with Level 1, it’s highly recommended as it will help you better understand the concepts discussed here in this Level 2 Course.

1193886,#12 Hand Coordination: Let your Hands dance with Ballad 9,"Learn How To Coordinate Both Hands
Many people want to learn how to coordinate both hands easily but after years of learning, they are still unable to coordinate both hands.
The problem is that we want to learn TOO many things at one goal.
Here's the SECRET:  Learn only ONE Specific Technique at one time
TECHNIQUE for this Course:  Dance with LH using Ballad 9
Piano Tip:When you can DANCE with your LH, you will be able to coordinate your RH easily!
Song:  God is so Good - C Key & D Key
________________________________________________
Purpose of this course:
1.  This course is designed to ‘help’ students apply  ONE Specific Piano Technique – the Dancing 9 to 4/4  songs.
2.  From my own experience of teaching, I notice that students need to DRILL one technique at a time to their songs so that the technique can become ‘automatic’ in their playing.  The series of video clips are prepared in slow motion and normal tempo so that students can practice, practice, and practice until they feel very comfortable in using the technique easily to songs.
3.  Therefore, this course is NOT about arranging a specific song.
4.  In order that students can come away with confidence in Mastering the Technique, the steps shown are very thorough and systematic in the  video clips and explained clearly in the eBook.  All that is left is for students to have FUN practising them at the piano!
This course will give you:
1. The Dancing 9 is  an EZ technique that you want to MASTER! This fun technique will help turn a plain song to  ‘dance’.   It will give momentum to your song. It will make your song ‘dance’ and not boring at all.
2.  Learn how to play the Dancing  9 in 8th notes.
3. My Secret Piano Tip of how to start implementing 16th note ballad playing into your songs!  This one is GOLD.  I know, because it took me years to come to this SECRET TIP of playing 16th Notes Easily.  Once you get this technique into your fingers, you will sound professional. Your songs will all sound fresh & contemporary! You will add newness to all the good ol’ fashioned Gospel Hymns!
4.  The video clips show you exactly how to play the Dancing 9 from 8th notes to prepare you to play 16th notes in the next course to WOW your audience!
5.  Step by step for you to follow exactly how to put them into your songs.  You will learn how to count to fit arpeggios into the melody of the song.
6.  Watch, copy and play, play, play. That’s what this course is about!
7.  With that foundation, you can go and experiment the idea and create your own Dancing 9 variations!

**There are a lot of Play Along in this course!**
My students have difficulty coordinating both hands together at times, so in this course I have done many play along for:
1. Left Hand only for each line for each song & then play through the complete song.
2. Both Hands in Slow Motion for each line for each song & then play through the complete song.
3. Both Hands in Normal Tempo for each line for each song & then play through the complete song.
The design is in such a way that students can slowly gain confidence by working on the Left Hand first, and then play through each line in slow motion, and finally play through each line in normal tempo.

The whole programis designed in such a way that students have a method to practice the techniques & to move them to play by ear.
1. Each line  is played with Music Score in front of them.
2. Each line  is played with Chords + counting
3. Each line is played with chords only so that by the time students get to this level, they can play by EAR.

Enjoy,
Rosa

But you just can’t figure out how tosimply ‘play’
Perhaps you have never tried to improvise before...

“How do I make my improvisation sound good?”
Perhaps some of you might have even gotten really good with your scales
You can probably play better than your friends on the guitar
Maybe you can play at blazing fast speeds
But your solos, or your improvisation, it all soundsstale
It doesn’t sound like music, but just a sequence of notes being played
If you can see yourself facing these problems….

Why can’t I solo as well as I want to?
What am I doing wrong?
Why am I stuck with the same old Pentatonic scale and can’t do anything else?

My name isFilippo Dall'Astaand I am a professional guitar player based in London, where I have been gigging and teaching guitar for the past 10 years.
I have been playing guitar for 20 years now and I have studied music in Italy, Germany, India and England.
In my music career I did a lot of research on improvisation and I found a lot of good courses and information on the internet
But I could never find any courses that have a proper system to guide beginners to understand the theory behind it, learn what scales to use and start improvising all in one.
All I could find was scattered information here and there,either very very basic or very advanced.
So I thought I needed to put a course together that would cover all those aspects
So that any beginner could start improvising in no timeand enjoy the freedom of expression that comes with it
Without having to waste countless hours collecting fragmented information here and there on the internet.
I know that there are thousands of videos and courses on improvisation buton this course you will get all the information that you would normally find separately on several courses
All boiled down into one!
This course is very interactive and fun, you are going to learn and play a lot as well.
You will realize thatimprovising is very easyonce you learn a couple of key elements and it doesn't take much time at all to get started.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But Don’t Take My Word For It. Here is what people had to say about this course:
""The course is designed to be thorough, and to guide the learner to see progress daily - and it works. I am having a lot of fun following this course and cannot recommend it highly enough.""- Adam Smedley
""I enjoyed the course and Filippo's teaching style. There is clear and logical explanation of the required music theory, followed by techniques for creative improvisation. This course fulfils the objectives stated in the course content, and I am enjoying practising the techniques learned. Highly recommended if this is of interest.""- Jon Cartoon
""Genuine? Helpful?Actually gives me a real place to start practicing?!So much yes.""- Kyle Loyd
""Fantastic course. So well done, Filippo. Great instruction. Very clear.Some ""lights"" really went on for me as a result of this course.I feel more confident with my leads and now have better command of the fretboard. To any potential students: if you are on the fence about taking this course, give it a shot. You'll be happy you did.""- Mark Allen
""Not being a complete beginner I still found this course very useful as it resolved some questions I had about music theory and improvisation.Also, Filippo strikes me as a very music passionate person and I would love seeing some other courses. P.S. Backing tracks are a huge bonus""- Ognjen Mišić
""This is by far the best online Guitar class I’ve ever taken. Well worth the investment.I have always been a good rhythm guitarist but was stuck in the pentatonic rut and didn’t understand chord theory and scales until now.I hope you create more courses! I’m telling all my friends who play guitar to buy this course! Thank you!""- Bob Bean
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2-5 Power Chordsare found in many standards and popular movie themes.  They make rich full sounds that will captivate your audience wanting more.
In this song ""Over the Rainbow"", I show you how to take a tune from its basic harmony  ( I  IV  V7 )  to advanced sophisticated chords.
""Over the Rainbow""  is a classic Academy Award winning ballad song written by Harold Arlen and lyrics by E.Y. Harburg. The song was written for the movie, ""The Wizard of Oz"" and was sung by Judy Garland.  Over time, this song became Garland's signature song.
First, we need to establish a harmonic foundation to the song with basic chords so that you understand how complex chords come into play.
I also put in a section on Easy Improvisation.  I show you different ways to improvise around the chord progressions so that you learn ""tone motion voice leading"".  Even when you don't play the actual melody of the song, you can hear the song in the background when you play the harmonic chord progressions. This is a good ear training program to help you play many standard and pop songs by EAR.

Strong rhythmic feel can take your playing to a professional level!
It's the difference between a YouTube cover artist who plays a 100 songs the same way (just a wash of that same rhythm pattern he or she knows), and somebody who can interpret songs authentically and create their own rhythm patterns.
Having a strong command of rhythm patterns allows each song to be different, not a wash of the same feeling.
That's why the music of piano wielding singer/songwriters like Ben Folds, Carole King, Sara Bareilles, Diane Birch, Gavin DeGraw, make you feel alive.  It's all in the Rhythm.
But how do you gain strong rhythmic feel?
It's not about memorizing a few rhythm patterns.  That's not what these artists are doing.
Gaining strong rhythmic feel requires rhythm pattern immersion.
This course will immerse you in the 8th note rhythm pattern feel that genre's such as Rock, Pop, Folk, Country, are built upon.
You'll play 8th note rhythm pattern, after 8th note rhythm pattern, after 8th note rhythm pattern, until that feel is internalized.
At the end of this immersion course you will have""8th note feel""and will be able to create your own rhythm patterns for your own songs, and cover other songs authentically.

I also put in a section on Easy Improvisation.  I show you different ways to improvise around the chord progressions so that you learn ""tone motion voice leading"".  Even when you don't play the actual melody of the song, you can hear the song in the background when you play the harmonic chord progressions. This is a good ear training program to help you play many standard and pop songs by EAR.
Learn New 2-5 Reharmonization Rules & Chord Substitutions to Aura Lee.
In this song, I teach you the melody, chords, and reharmonization note-for-note using 2-5 Power chord method.
This ""Series to play poplular songs by ear"" aims to give you practical instructions to playing rich sounding chords even to a simple tune such as this one.
In the full arrangement of Aura Lee, you will be playing these chords:
CM7
F#m7b5
B7
Am7
D7,
Db7,
C6/9
Em7,
Ebdim7
E7

Learn Piano Level 10 is the toughest of all 9 levels.
Imagine, now that you have learned how to do Chord Substitutions from Level 1 to Level 10, you can arrange a simple song like Away in a Manger with advanced chords and play the song with professional sounds. By reharmonizing the song in these 10 levels, you can reharmonize any simple songs in this way to give them sophisticated professional sounds.
In Level 10,we’ve come to the most dissonant chord in the Key of C:  Tritone chord substitutions.  'Tritone' is the tone that is 3 (tri) whole steps above or below the original dominant 7 Chord.   The most dissonant interval between any two tones is 3 whole steps up or 3 whole steps down.
When we watch musicians playing a piece of arrangement, they don't need to think too much to create new advanced chords, such as the tritone chords.
Here's the Secret:Whenever you play the Tritone Chord Substitution, use my trick. Let your fingers move to the b5 of the chord and play the new chord moving to the next chord that is 1/2 step down.
That's it!
That's why they create smooth sounding basslines that mesmerize the audience.
Learn some new tips on how to put in Tritone Chord substitutions into your music arrangement of Away in a Manger.
Tip 1:  Tritone's Unique Interval - Tensed
Tip 2:  Tritones present in Dominant 7 Chords
Tip 3:  Dominant & Respective Tritone Chord Sub share the same 2 tones
Tip 4:  Simple Trick to find Tritone Chord Sub
Tip 5:  Step 1 - Do Db7 Chord Sub to G7
Tip 6:  Step 2 - Do Eb7 Chord Sub to Em7
Tip 7:  Step 3 - Do Gb7 Chord Sub to C7
Tip 8:  Piano Technique 1:  Tritone Chord resolves 1/2 step down
Tip 9:  Piano Technique 2:  Tritone Chord Progression - Beautiful Bass Line
Tip 10:  Piano Technique 3:  Alternate Tritone Chord Progression
Learn how to Insert and Substitute with these new Tritone Chords:
bII7
bIII7
bV7

bVII7

When you know how to apply Tritone Chord substitution into Away In A Manger, you will be able to apply them to any songs.

Instead of playing the normal chord progression of:  Em7   Am7   Dm7   G7     C
You will learn to play it in 2 possibilities using Tritone Chord Substitutions, creating 1/2 step movement from one chord to another.

1119610,Harmonica Jamz: The Only Course on Jammin' with Friends,"What would it feel like if you knew that you are a master of this tiny, cool instrument - the harmonica, that you can play any song on it, and you can beautifully jam with your guitarist friends?
To know that you can always simply take out this great little instrument - and just have a blast with it.
Welcome to the course that'll let you do it all!
-
Do you want to play a cool instrument - the harmonica, and to be able to play music with other people? Do you want to play dozens of famous songs on your harmonica, and also to be able to improvise and create your own beautiful solos when jammin' with other people?
This course is exactly what you're looking for, and you will learn all of that in several weeks. Yes, the harmonica is an easy instrument!
In three sentences, what the course is about?
Do you know Bob Dylan? Neil Young? Other famous rockers who jam the harmonica that you like?
This course is your one stop shop for learning how to play songs and jam on the harmonica BETTER than all of these guys, quickly.
And you DON'T have to have previous musical experience - since it is designed for experienced musicians or total beginners alike. Harmonicas are easy - and this is the optimized, most effective way to learn it.

Why should you listen to me?
Hi, my name is Alon Cooper. I am a music artist, touring the world while running my online teaching business, playing venues with a band / solo, and learning with the most inspiring musicians wherever I go. In the last 8 years I've spent long periods in Australia, northern Europe, the USA, Sri Lanka, and more. Originally I am from Tel Aviv, Israel.
I hope I can be your helpful friend on your musical journey.
I have a huge passion for passing on my knowledge and seeing others succeed. In 2014 I founded the blog GuitarSongsMasters-com, and shortly after also created the accompanying Guitar Songs Masters video courses - that have gained over 100K students so far.
---
""Excellent course, I never played any instrument before but after a couple of jam sessions with Alon I was already jamming with my dad at home. The quality of the video editing and the helpful texts on screen were also very impressive."" Josh Cole, England.
Wait. Why should I play the harmonica anyway?
Well, harmonicas are unique instruments in a couple of ways. They are:
Easy to learn and to play.(when done with the right teaching method)
Extremelycompact- can always in your backpack or pocket, ready to play.
AFFORDABLE.40$ buy you the best ones, hand-made in Germany.
Socialinstruments - alwaysready to jamwith other guitarists and friends.
Sound great withmultiple music genresfrom rock, to blues, to pop and country.
Develop your earsandfeelfor the music.
Why shouldn't I take another course or just watch free YouTube lessons?
Two reasons:
1) Your time is valuable, and trying to learn your way through random lessons on random harmonica topics (instead of using a systematic, proven approach) will never get you as far as where I can take you - and in a much shorter time.
2)The course is is built in a unique way which makes it the most interactive(and therefore - fun and easy to learn from) harmonica course online. After each lecture, we will have an interactive jam session where you will be playing the harmonica along to the relevant music, while the key points that we just talked about will be right in front of you, in a text form.
This way, you have fun while the knowledge gets implemented in your brain and gets you ready to get out there and jam with real people.
*The course is professionally produced and filmed in a boutique music studio, and instandards of qualitythat are unknown in the harmonica videos world. The lessons are a joy to watch and listen to - as you can see in the previews.
What are the topics that are covered in the course? How will they help me?
We cover two big topics: 1) Playing Songs. 2) Improvising music and jammin' with other people.
It is all done using the following ""building blocks"":
Playing the harmonica withthe tone of a professional- to get the most beautiful sound you can out of your harp.
Learning to play single notes - this will enable you toenrich your musical pallete and play ANY song.
We will learn specifically how toplay some famous rock songsto get you started.
You will learn the essentials of music theory - this will enable you tostart IMPROVISING your own riffs.
When you know how to improvise, you can confidentlyget out there and jam with other musicians!
You willacquire a solid sense of rhythmthrough the Harmonica Rhythm Method™. Rhythm is one of the biggest foundations to sound great on any music instrument.
You will know all the notes of the harmonica in all three octaves. This means you will be able toplay songs by earand to improvise with ease - instead of randomly ""shooting in the dark"" like how most amateur harmonica players do.
All the lessons are built in a revolutionary, interactive way. How exactly?
In the first part of each lesson - I am in the studio, teaching you the new technique while giving examples on HD video.
In the second part of each lesson - the course becomes totally interactive - I am playing a jam track for you, (in beautiful, live HD video as you can see in the free preview) while you are at home jammin' along. On screen I will be reminding you, through text, all the key points we just talked about.
So you get to learn while havin' fun and while you are much more likely to ingrain the material than with any other course out there!
Sound good! You mentioned that we'll learn some songs. Which songs exactly?
Yes! Playing songs' melodies is one of the most satisfying musical experiences you can have.
In the course, I will show you my examples of those songs, and then you will get to play them yourself while I show you the harmonica notes on screen and the music is playing for you in the background withoutmyharmonica. (check out the preview of ""Let It Be"".
The songs that we will learn include:
The Beatles - Let It Be
Leonard Cohen - Hallelujah
Old Crow Medicine Show - Wagon Wheel
Louis Armstrong - What A Wonderful World
Bob Marley - Jammin'
Neil Young - Heart of Gold
Bob Dylan - Knockin' on Heaven's Doors
The Rolling Stones - Angie
You Are My Sunshine
Elvis Presley - Can't Help Falling in Love with You

1116196,Essential Theory and Technique for Guitar,"The Essential Theory and Technique for Guitar course is designed for two main types of people; the beginner guitar player who has no guitar or musical experience and those who can play guitar a little bit but are wanting to understand the music theory behind what they are playing and to improve on their technique.
Music Is A Language
Learning music is like learning a language. Music notes are like letters of the alphabet. When you learn how to combine them, you can create chords, which are like words, and with words you can create sentences and tell stories.
There are some great guitar players who don’t necessarily know all of the theory behind what they are playing, but using the above analogy of music as a language, imagine the potential that is being missed out on by not fully understanding what you are playing. If you were taking a trip to France, you could buy a translation book that could tell you how to say certain phrases in French, such as “Where is the bathroom?” or “What time is it?”, but imagine how much more you could communicate if you were able to construct your own sentences and phrases in French? You could say whatever you wanted without limits. Music is similar; by understanding the“why”, and practicing the“how”you reduce the limitations and open up a world of opportunity to express yourself with your instrument.
The course includes a full color PDF E-Book which is over 50 pages and provides further explanation of the material in the videos as well as guitar neck diagrams for your reference.
This course is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and should provide you with weeks worth of material to work on.
The topics you will learn in this course include;
Part 1: Parts of the Guitar
Part 2: The Musical Alphabet
Part 3: Notes on the Neck (Watch for free on this page)
Part 4: Neck Diagrams
Part 5: Holding the Guitar
Part 6: Holding the Pick (Watch for free on this page)
Part 7: Picking the Strings
Part 8: Left Hand Technique (Watch for free on this page)
Part 9: The Chromatic Scale (Watch for free on this page)
Part 10: The Spider Exercise
Part 11: The C-Major Scale
Part 12: What is a “Key?”
Part 13: Standard Notation
Part 14: How Chords Are Made

Struggles with many pianists:  They are stuckand do not know how to dress up a song.  How can we make a ‘slow’ going song and turn it into something that is not boring and dynamic?

Ask yourself: when the 3 beat melody tones are one after another, what we can do to break up the monotony?  In such cases, an quiet Open 10th technique sounds really good.
Look for patterns in the song.
The pattern in this song is very repetitive.  So we need to find places to create as much drama as possible.
Find as many places as possible to make artistic sounds.
You are gong to learn how to apply 3 different Techniques to this plain 9/4 Song:

Amazing, over 70 techniques to add to any song to dress up your music and make them extraordinarily beautiful. The Waterfall Run is just one of my favorites that Rosa teaches. This course is jam packed with ideas and they are all fun to learn. Exciting course!
From Alene Thornton:
This is great to have all these techniques in one course! Tons of techniques to learn and so nice to have them all in one place so not having to hunt thru all the other levels of the Reharm courses to find them.
From Julie:
I love the demos that are in this course. It makes me want to play the piano easily and Rosa makes it so much fun and motivating. Very inspiring for me.
From John T. CEO
The handshapes here are marvelous as I find that I can now play easily on the piano splashing in these color tones without memorizing any notes. Rosa has a super method going here that everyone should learn. I never heard about these 2t6 and 3t6 or 4t6 but I now know why they do the magic especially when we do runs going up the keyboard. I love this course.
From Betty:
These finger tricks are very helpful as there's nothing to memorize. Rosa shows you how to use those fingers to create those beautiful sounds quickly. I like the handshapes idea, especially with people who have small hands. They are great and handy. Really like all these tips.

***UPDATE APRIL 2021. NEW SECTION ADDED: PLAYING BY EAR***
(This new section could actually be a whole course on its own, but is just included in this piano course!)
You want to play your favorite song by ear, without having sheet music, chords or melody?
After this new 2.5-hour section you will be able to sit at the piano and play any song, just by listening attentively, derive chords and melody and then play the song, by ear!
Surprise everyone playing any song on the piano with this amazing technique!



THE ONLINE PIANO COURSE THAT HELPED 1000'S OF PEOPLE TO FINALLY PLAY SONGS ON THE PIANO, TO READ MUSIC AND TO IMPROVISE
The way the course is created, with lots of songs and easy explanations of every detail, means that you will advance rapidly every day.

VERY QUICKLY, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PLAY YOUR FIRST SONGS ON THE PIANO OR KEYBOARD
At a very early stage, you will already apply what you’ve learned and start playing songs. First playing the melody with your right hand, later also adding your left hand.
And what makes it a real pleasure to practice, is that you play a song together with a band that accompanies you while you are playing on your piano or electronic keyboard.
This is what others say about the course:
***

This piano course is extremely educational and highly entertaining as well. For beginners specially, Mr. Cohen didn't raise the bar of excellence, he is the bar simply put. His lectures will start you from know nothing into craving to learn more and highly addictive too. If you are searching over and over to find the right piano lesson for you, your search is over. You found the learning center. Cheers (Rolando Marucut)

***

This is exactly the course I was looking for. I love piano music since I was a kid, however I never had the opportunity to learn. I am a total beginner, I love the way the teacher explains and shows the most important and key things in order to move forward in any lesson. My dream is closer. Thank you so much! (Daniel Madrid Sanchez)

***

WOW! This is an amazing course. Thank you very much. Highly recommended. (Stefano Buiaroni)

***

I really liked the way the course was created, with lots of songs, advices, quizzes. It was a challenge, but with perseverance and with a lot of exercises the results appeared. I think the most pleasant moments were when I played the songs from the course, but by far I think it was when I managed to control both hands independently. It was like a revelation. Now I have the needed tools: scales, chords, improvisation techniques, the rest depends on me, a lot of exercises. (Csizmadia Miklos)

***

LEARN PIANO IN A FUN WAY, NOT BY ONLY ENDLESSLY RUNNING UP & DOWN THE SCALES
In order to play the piano or keyboard well, you have to practice scales. But only endlessly going up & down the scales is not very fun way of learning the piano or keyboard, that’s why in this course you practice the scales in songs that contain just the notes of that particular scale.
And of course, the band will accompany you in all the songs.
This makes practicing the scales a pleasure!

TRY THIS ONLINE PIANO COURSE WITHOUT ANY RISK.
If you’re still not sure, why not just give it a try? It’s without any risk: if for whatever reason this is not the course for you, you can get a full refund within 30 days after purchase.
So, there’s no need to wait any longer: just hit that ‘enroll’ button and get access to more than 23 hours of video, interactive music theory exercises and to two amazing BONUSSES: a110-page eBook with all the scales and chords in all the inversions with finger positions, an 84-page eBook with the whole music theory and how to read notes, as well as plenty of other resources (play-along files in different tempos, PDF files with sheet music for every song, …).
It only takes you one click to have access to ALL of this.

Still not convinced?
Just have a look at the promo video and the free preview videos to have an idea of how I teach, and also have a look at the course curriculum.



COURSE CHARACTERISTICS
You will apply the theory and skills learned during the lectures in songs that you will play together with a band (play-along mp3 files and MIDI files included). In this way, practicing the notes in the scales becomes a pleasure!

Lots of practice files (mp3 and MIDI) in all 12 keys and in several tempos included

Two eBooks included for FREE:

- “Basic scales and chords”: with ALL the scales and chords in all inversions with finger positions (110 pages!) with clickable index that leads you directly to the scale or chord you were looking for.

- “Music theory and music reading”: with the whole music theory and how to read notes (84 pages) that can be used as a handy reference book beside the course.

More than 450 downloadable resources! (more than any other piano course)

Here's My Secret: Rosa's Unique Transfer Chord Technique - Use 2 Hands to play chords to create new sounds!
Our struggles:
we have already acquired some very basic skills to play good accompaniment to our songs, but we have reached a plateau that everything we play sounds very similar.
we  want to get out of the boring LH arpeggios but cannot because we don’t know how else to play them.
we are frustrated trying to figure out how to fit the entire arpeggio into a song.
we do not know how to count the arpeggios to make them fit to the melody of the song.
we find our LH ballad playing so predictable and boring that they even put us to sleep at times.
we feel stuck in a rut and do not know how to spice up our ballad playing.
If this is your experience, this new series of “Mastering Fun Piano Techniques” using my Transfer Chord Technique from Left Hand to Right Hand to add new sounds.

2.  From my own experience of teaching, I notice that students need toDRILLone technique at a time to their songs so that the technique can become‘automatic’in their playing.  The series of video clips are prepared in slow motion and normal tempo so that students can practice, practice, and practice until they feel verycomfortablein using the technique easily to songs.
3.  In order that students can come away with confidence inMastering the Flowing Ballad 9 Transfer Chord Technique, the steps shown are very thorough and systematic in the  video clips and explained clearly in the lectures.  All that is left is for students to have FUN practising them at the piano!

5. Use the Color chord piano tip to put color tones into your ballad arpeggios playing.

995562,Play Piano 1 Master Class Intro:  Standards 2-5 Power Chords,"The 2-5 Power Chord - Use this method to play Standards & Popular Songs by EAR

Have you ever wondered how composers or musicians play such rich arrangements to their songs?
When we open a fake book or look at a music arrangement, we scratch our heads and wonder how composers decide on choosing those chords?
Is it just a matter of guess work of using those chords because they sound good to our ears?
Some professional musicians wish to have a fuller arrangement in their songs, so they try to look for a harmonizing chord to 'almost' every melody tone.  What is the quickest method to get to a beautiful arrangement without wasting time on guess work?
I have developed thisAmazing 2-5 Power Chord Reharmonization Methodto help you gain success to playing your favorite standards.
2-5 Power Chords are found in many standards and popular movie themes.  They make rich full sounds that will captivate your audience wanting more.
This course is an introductory course to get you going using 2-5 Chords.
You need to learn the TWELVE 2-5-1 Major Chord Progression
You need to learn the TWELVE 2-5-1 Minor Chord Progression
Learn how to play the 2-5-1 Chord Pogression on the  Left Hand
Learn how to play the 2-5-1 in stepwise movement for smooth voicing
Once you are able to play these 24 Two-Five in Major & Minor Chord Progressions, you will find it very easy to understand complex chord progressions that we see in the Advanced Fake Books & Movie songs.
______________________________
With the 2-5 Power Chord Method,I have developed a newseries of Standards and Popular songsto show you how to put in the 2-5 Power Chords.
1.  Love Me Tender (Aura Lee)
2.  Some Enchanted Evening
3.  Yesterday
4.  Misty
5.  The Way We Were
6.  For All We Know
7.  Over the Rainbow
8.  The Way You Look Tonight
9.  Where Do I begin?
10.  All I Ask Of You
11.  Unchained Melody
12. My Heart Will Go On
13.  Moon River
14.  You Light Up My LIfe
In each song, I show you how to take a tune from its basic harmony  ( I  IV  V7 )  to advanced chords in other keys.  First, we need to establish a harmonic foundation to the song with basic chords so that you understand how complex chords come into play.
I also put in a section on Easy Improvisation.  I show you different ways to improvise around the chord progressions so that you learn ""tone motion voice leading"".  Even when you don't play the actual melody of the song, you can hear the song in the background when you play the harmonic chord progressions. This is a good ear training program to help you play many standard and pop songs by EAR.
Come on in and enroll in this course,

971962,Learn Guitar: Zero to Guitar Fingerpicking in 30 days,"Learn Guitar: Go from complete beginner to guitar fingerpicking in 30 Days
Hi - my name is Patrick and welcome to my course - guitar fingerpicking in 30 days. I have being fingerpicking guitar for 20 years and I have taught dozens of students to go from never having picked up a guitar before to being really accomplished players.
Have you ever dreamed of playing guitar or even started but then faded away after a while? Do you think it's going to be years of practice before you sound good? Would you be excited if I told you you didn't have to just play boring chords for the first six months - you could actually be fingerpicking within 30 days?
Over the years, I have experimented and realised that there is a way to teach students that seems like starting with what many would believe to be a 'complex' or 'advanced' style - fingerpicking using the thumb and three fingers - is actually the best way for a complete beginner to learn.
There is good reason for this. The traditional method of learning chords and strumming them is relatively easy to do, but actually surprisingly hard to do well. Listen to any beginner strum a set of chords and you see it is hard for the beginner to sound musical after a couple of days. But if you start picking strings individually, then after 4 or 5 days, you can play some really nice pieces. And this is the key: rewarding the student from day one, enabling them to sound musical within the first week. Believe me, I have seen this work time and time again.
When you want to learn the guitar, it matters hugely which course and teacher you pick. The cost of getting this wrong isn't that you lose out on $30-50, it is that the teaching may not stick for you and you may end up with a life where you never learn guitar, rather a life where picking up the guitar is a huge joy and pleasure for you, whether just on your own or playing with other musicians.
For a complete beginner, there is no more effective and no more enjoyable, musical and confidence building way than to start with a couple of chords and a fingerpicking technique.
How is this course structured?
This course is designed to be followed by students in a 30 day period. Of course, some students may go faster and some slower - (if you cover this material in 60 days, you're still doing a great job). The course has five sections
Getting Started - some basic information, identifying string names, a few chords, reading tablature, using a metronome
Fingerpicking Basics - the background to how fingerpicking works, the big rule, several fingerpicking patterns
The Thumb - the key to getting that 'two guitar effect' is for the thumb to do the work of the bass player; alternating bass, walking bass, more fingerpicking patterns
The Fingers - adding more advanced patterns to the right hand fingers, pinching, different sequence length and writing your own fingerpicking patterns
Advanced - clear breakdowns of advanced techniques like Travis Picking and Clawhammer
Note that each section has 5-7 individual lessons with a homework exercise after each lesson. At the beginning of the following lesson, I will give tips for anyone stuck with practical ways to get it mastered if you're finding it difficult.

At the end of my course, students will be able to...
play the most common guitar chords in a fingerpicking style
understand how to break down fingerpicking patterns into the bass/thumb and the melody/fingers and how to practice building up the component parts
read tablature and play along to a metronome
have a formula for composing their own fingerpicking patterns
play in travis picking and clawhammer styles

What materials will come with this course?
Each lesson has a HD video with three camera angles (full, left hand and right hand) so that you can zone in and see what each hand is doing. Each lesson also comes with a downloadable PDF and the relevant music tablature for each lesson.

Who should take this course?
This course is ideal for complete beginners. You don’t need to know anything about music or guitar playing to start. If you own or can borrow a guitar for thirty days, then you’re all set.
It is also perfect for “failed beginners”. Students who maybe toyed around with a guitar for a few months, maybe even learned a few chords but got bored because it wasn’t musical or rewarding enough and just strumming those few chords never sounded that great. If you don’t mind going slowly at first to get to more than just strumming chords, then this is for you.
Note that you do not need any previous experience with music to take this course.

Who should not?
If you having been playing guitar for years and have already several fingerpicking pieces you can play, this course could be too basic for you.

What will students need before starting the course?
Students will need to have a guitar.

If you want to give this course a try, remember that Udemy backs your purchase with a 30 day full refund option on all courses on Udemy - including this one. So you can always give it a go with absolutely no risk and get picking within the first few lessons or get your money back. This course is the best way to get musical within the first days, as promised you above.

970880,"Blues Guitar Lessons for Beginners: Chords, Rhythm and Lead","Have you ever wanted to take private lessons from the world's greatest professional blues guitar player?
Yeah, me too...
How about settling for me instead?
Consider this...
I've played guitar on and off over the last several decades and consider myself to still be an advanced beginner.
Which probably makes me a better guitarist than you.
Another thing to consider...
I seem to be a good teacher.
I've taught several friends how to play blues rhythm and lead guitar.
Now I'm asking you to join the group.
Not because I'm a great guitarist (I'm far from it).
Not because I've developed some revolutionary new teaching method (though I may have).
Not because I'm out to make a million dollars (though, wouldn't that be great?).
I'm asking you to join me because it will be fun... for both of us.
This course is unique in that I'm not a very good guitar player.  So, taking this course is more like sharing guitar tips with a buddy.  It's less intimidating than spending lots of money learning from a professional.
Come on!  Let's play blues guitar together.
There are few things more rewarding on this planet than making music with someone!
We'll begin with learning how to play open E and open A power chords - the core of the blues and rock 'n' roll - using 1 finger per chord.
Then we'll learn to add a B chord using a second finger --- from there we're off to the races...
Power chords, open chords, bar chords.  Rock 'n' roll rhythm and the blues shuffle rhythm.  It's all here in guitar chord diagrams and tablature.
The course includes information on how to play lead guitar and comes to a climax with a solo blues intro, shuffle, turn around, singing with lead conclusion.
By the end of the course you'll know everything you need to play beginner blues rhythm and lead guitar.
Or your money back.  No, seriously.
Udemy offers a 30 day no questions asked money back guarantee on any course purchased.  So, there goes your risk!
So, have you ever wanted to learn how to play blues guitar?
Why not join me for a 1-on-1 buddy session while we learn together?
I'll see you in the classroom,

In this foundational course, I teach you how to play piano as a singer/songwriter. It's a unique method that takes somebody with zero musical experience and transforms them into a piano wielding singer/songwriter.

Every lecture builds upon the previous lecture.  I walk you through the whole process as efficiently as possible, taking every effort to find ways to cut your learning time in half.
Watch the lectures, complete the challenges, and enjoy playing! By the end you should be able to pick a song, adjust the song to most singable key for your voice, and accompany yourself on the piano.
You should take this course if you think you'd have fun playing the songs you love and exploring how piano wielding singer/songwriters like Carol King, Alicia Keys, and Ben Folds express themselves on the piano.
This is a foundational course for beginners. This course is meant to be an alternative to a traditional piano lesson schedule.

26956,Learn Guitar in 21 Days,"
Most beginners think that you need to know thousands of chords to play thousands of songs. NOT SO! You really only need to know a handful of chords and a few strumming patterns to play thousands of rock, folks, blues and pop songs.
The reason guitar is the most popular instrument on the planet is because it's the quickest and easiest instrument to learn how to play. You do NOT need to read music. You do NOT need to learn music theory. You do NOT need to struggle through exercises, or practice scales, or learn how to play Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Fact is that thousands of popular songs can be played with 8 simple chords or less. Learn just the A chord, D chord and E chord and you'll be able to play hundreds of blues, folk, pop and rock songs. Why is this so? Because rock, pop, folk and blues songwriters all use the same handful of chords - it's their melodies and arrangements that make their songs distinctive, NOT the chords they are using in the song.
So, if you learn that handful of chords, and learn those few strumming patterns, along with the basics of holding and tuning a guitar, then you too will be able to play thousands of songs. And that's the simple truth.
World renowned guitar educator Ravi has taught thousands of people to play their favorite songs on guitar with his breakthrough 21-day course. The ""trick"" behind this course is really no trick at all; over the 21 days you'll learn how to hold and tune the guitar, how to play eight simple chords, how to strum, and how to keep a beat.
No gimmicks. No ""magic"" formula. No nonsense.
You will need to set 20 minutes a day aside for your practice sessions. No more and no less. And you are asked to do this for 21 days straight. Yes, you can skip a day or two but the daily repetition and practice regiment is the key to your success.
Ravi has also included additional lessons for you to work with beyond the 21 days. You'll learn more open position chords, the moveable barre chord system (worth the price of admission alone!), how to read chord charts, and how to easily and quickly learn songs from sheet music, song books and lyric sheets that you download from the internet.
Ravi will step you through the course and each of your practice sessions on the video lessons. Follow the course for those 21 days and beyond and we guarantee that you'll be prepared to start playing and building your own repertoire of favorite songs to accompany yourself or play in a band setting.
No, you will not be an Eric Clapton in 21 days and we wouldn't suggest you book your first gig on the 22nd day BUT you will be a guitar player and you will be well equipped to learn ALL of your favorite songs.
If you've always wanted to learn to play guitar so that you can strum along and sing your favorite songs, Learn Guitar in 21 Days is likely the answer you've been seeking. Grab your guitar, boot up Ravi's first lesson and let's start making music right away!
NOTE!We get asked all the time why a guitar educational company with so many advanced courses would offer such a simple solution to learning guitar without having to learn how to read music, learn theory or work through a more ""formal"" learning methodology. The answer is really simple; you never stop learning music but you do have to start. If your introduction to music is boring, tedious and generally a struggle, you'll likely pack the guitar up in its case and stick it in the closet. If it's fun, engaging and you can prove to yourself that you can really do it, then you'll spend a lifetime enjoying and learning guitar. Hopefully, TrueFire and our massive library of instruction will enhance that lifetime of enjoyment.

A time signature represents the length of the melody in a song.There are common signatures, such as quadruple (4/4) and triple (3/4) time. Most songs are written in this time.However, some songs are written in uncommon time signatures, such as 5/4, 7/4, and 9/4.   Once you know how to play songs in 9/4, you will be able to play in 3/8, 6/8 or 9/8 also.Time signatures are written as fractions. The top number represents how many beats there are in a measure, and the bottom number represents the note value which makes one beat.In a 9/4 Song, it means that there are 9 Beats in a measure.
In this course, I am going to show you the following piano techniques:
Play Open 10th Ballad in the flow

101500,Guitar Lessons - Blind Blake - King Of Ragtime Blues Guitar,"Blind Blake was a complete master of ragtime blues guitar - so how do we define that?First of all, his performances had a joyful quality typical of the ragtime piano feel of the likes of Scott Joplin which the style emulated. Secondly, Blake introduced some techniques that gave the music a syncopation that almost defies belief. Although his playing inspired many artists since his passing, very few can capture the feel of his picking patterns. He picked with his bare thumb and probably two fingers. A great many legendary blues men used just one finger for picking acoustic blues, but the triplets you can hear in much of Blake's music makes this just about impossible. His fingers were indeed fast and very, very accurate.He would vary his techniques within a song to make it more interesting and exciting, singing along with an alternating bass picking pattern and regularly throwing in fast single string runs picked with his thumb and forefinger. He could also reverse his bass picking pattern seemingly at will, also changing from a two string pattern to a three string variation. He might double up on the timing in the middle of a song and then seamlessly return without missing a beat (for example, Tootie Blues). When he combined all of these techniques in one song, it was formidable.Blake's most famous technique is also the one most difficult to copy. He would slip or roll his thumb from one bass string to another, so instead of hearing one bass note per beat, we hear two! Your thumb needs to be super disciplined to do this correctly, as your fingers will be picking the treble strings at the same time! Now it's time to sing as well - wow, this is great fun! Good Luck.

In this course you will learn from my 20+ years experience working with analog synths, all of the ins and outs of using analog synths and begin Sound Designing today. I say sound designing, as the components you will learn about are the fundamental components of this course, and are critical and essential for sound design.
Have you ever sat there and said, man! I wish that sound lasted a bit longer, or I wish it did not start so harsh, or it did this or that. If you have asked that question, than you are in the right place, because that is what this course was designed to teach.
I made this course to serve you the knowledge and understanding that it takes to really reveal and expose the power of synths, especially analog based synths. It does not matter if it is analog modeled or an actual analog synth, the same principles apply.
I am going to take you through analog synthesizers one step at a time, and break down a complex interacting device into smaller and more manageable pieces. First we will start with the overview, and then section by section. After that we start work on the interactions, the most fun part about analog synths. The interactions is what makes the analog highly desired and sought after, and its essentially the fundamental components used in many places. The fact is filters and envelopes are used in a massive array of technology, and in this course you will start to understand the wide universe of applications as you listen and hear sounds, now you will have some new understanding of how those sounds or made or how that EDM or Trance track is created. You will be equipped to use off-the-shelf synthesizers and quickly be able to wow sounds out of them, you will become the synth master.
I have owned many analog synths and now they are more readily available than ever. With micro keyboards, to software synth, and craigslist as well as ebay, there are so many ways to own analog synths. Not only that, but even the digital synths work the same, they have the same basic components and filters and envelopes.
I show you the fun and excitement of tweaking analog synths, just like you were in my own lab and studio, and of course feel free to ask questions, and let me know if you are missing something, I want to help you understand and get comfortable with analog synths. I have amassed this knowledge and I want to pass it on to you, so you can go and do all the fun and exciting things with analog synths.

51752,Just chords Piano: Learn to Play Piano Quickly - No Music,"
Learn to play the piano really quickly without needing to learn music.
Just Chords Pianois the perfect course for you to take beginners piano lessons with? It teaches you what you need to know to play piano in the way you want to play.
This course is designed to teach an absolute beginner to teach piano using chords and not music. This method of learning piano is perfect if you do not wish to learn music or play any form of classical music.
Type of lessons.
To take this course you download and print a provided textbook. This textbook is used throughout the High Definition video lessons of the course. Each lesson will end with a practice schedule for you to use between lessons.
Why no music?
Almost all songs you will play are played using chords, rather than you playing the melody line, which is how playing with music is usually done. The melody is the job of the singer to do, not the pianist.
You could have no desire to play songs following sheet music. For you, the fun element may be more important than the discipline of learning to read music.
Consequently learning music is irrelevant to you. However this is not to say that music should be completely discarded, you may decide to play piano songs, as quickly as possible now, by using the chord method. You may consider playing by music at a later date.
Problems.
The chords approach may be seen as a problem by you. You may suspect that if the music is not taught, you could have bad playing habits in the future.
Just Chords Pianoonly teaches correct musical terminology and techniques throughout all of its lessons.
You will not need to learn music in this course of study as it is unnecessary. You learn everything else properly as you would privately.
The methods you will learn by in this course, are purposely designed, to allow you to learn music at a later date, if you choose to do so, without having to re-learn or even unlearn anything.
How are lessons taught?
You will:
Be taught by piano lessons in video format, thus you will need your device near to your piano or keyboard.
Need to download a workbook and print it as you will need it throughout the course.
Always take lessons sequentially, as they must be taken in order, for you to get the best from the course.
require a pencil to take notes as you progress through the course. Your course book is ideal for this task.
In subsequent lessons your knowledge will be expanded with lessons teaching:
A multitude of chords.
How to play them properly.
Playing with two hands.
Where to find the chords and words for songs.
Methods of interpreting songs.
How to use dynamics to improve how your songs sound.
Some great introductions to sound great.
Turn a-rounds to fill in the gaps.
Great song endings.
Keeping time.
Rhythms.
Quality.
I have done everything possible for you, to make your taking of Just Chords Piano lessons, as near as possible to the quality you would receive if you came to me for private lessons.
You always receive personal support from me, Jackie. Consequently, I believed that my support is at least equal to, or better than a private tutor would provide for you.
Student input.
You the student are learning to play the piano. You, therefore, have a responsibility to take the provided lessons in sequence and carry out the practice schedules required of you.
Playing the piano is a practical activity. We get better at doing things by practising them. Olympic athletes become so because they practice.
Taking a lesson without understanding it, or practising what has been learned afterwards, will result in you failing to learn to play.
If you do not understand anything in a lesson, you go over the lesson again, if you still do not understand. Ask for help! Support is all about asking for help. You will need to make a commitment to yourself to practice every day for around 10 minutes. Everyone can find ten minutes a day to achieve a dream.
Summary.
With Just Chords Piano you will:
Learn to play the piano using chords and no music.
Need to go over again any aspect of a lesson that you don't understand, or ask for help before you continue to the next lesson in the course.
Practice every day for just ten minutes and you will be well on the way to achieving your dream of learning to play the piano using these easy simple piano lessons for beginners.
Be able to play your favourite songs in not time at all. Confident of your abilities as a pianist.
Most songs are played using piano chords, this allows easy playing and singing. The melody is done by the voice, not the piano. So it makes sense to learn piano by playing chords.
The course lessons will teach you the basics properly. You will soon know all the notes of the piano and how to use them to play chords. You will rapidly progress to playing simple tunes. At all times you will be told exactly what to practice so your progress is sound. Within a few months, you will easily be able to play your favourite songs. all you need to do then is be amazed at how you improve by playing them.
Of course, full support is available from Jackie, who will quickly get you back on track.
This is what one student said:
""Great course going really well, easy to learn, never played before, now I can, and still learning started late in life""
And another said:
""This is a very good course and the materials are a great reference, especially for practising offline and using the material to write down chords for songs. I have her book Play Piano with Chords so the course goes well with it. I'm looking forward to continuing the lessons, especially since additional sessions were added so it's even better. Jackie is a very good and patient instructor and this comes across in the lessons. Glad I signed up""

Christian Overton – Trombone instructor:
If you ask jazz trombonist Christian Overton when his musical destiny unfolded, you’ll get a refreshingly simple story. Don’t wait for swooning tales about obscure jazz records with intricate trombone solos and performances that set him on the unchangeable path to becoming a musician. All that inspiration actually followed after an older brother introduced the trombone to a young Christian one day in the family room. “I thought I would be ahead of my grade six music class,” Christian confesses with charismatic honesty. From precocious schoolboy to Humber music performance graduate, Christian Overton is now one of Toronto’s leading jazz musicians and writers—who also admits “…all the saxophones were taken by the time the teacher got to the letter ‘O’.” Growing up in Sudbury, Ontario, Christian’s childhood was comic books, snow, and music appreciation for fun. His father (one of Northern Ontario’s foremost radio personalities) played all sorts of tunes for the four Overton kids to enjoy. Sessions of classical Beethoven changed to the smooth seventies rock of Chicago and then backtracked to The Beatles. The defining moment, however, of Christian’s fascination with jazz happened with a gift from his uncle—Mellow-Dy by Slide Hampton. “Slide played things on the trombone I never heard before or even dreamed were possible.” After that first trombone lesson in a house filled with music, a life all about jazz was taking shape. Christian’s formal music education became an important experience. He was fortunate to attend schools with highly regarded music programs where his abilities were encouraged and challenged. As a teenager, Christian continued to explore the giants of trombone history, listening endlessly to the sweet melodies of JJ Johnson and carefully noting Curtis Fuller’s technical mastery. “I used to listen to the records and learn the solos too,” says Christian. “I could eventually play along with them note for note.” Surrounded by these influences and dedicated teachers, Christian soon showed great promise as a trombonist, improviser, and bandleader. In fact, when he was nearly finished high school, he was already leading a working jazz trio and had professional experience in every genre from dance bands to symphony orchestras and studio work.
Leaving his Sudbury home, Christian accepted a scholarship for jazz performance at Humber College in Toronto where he excelled both in the classroom and on the college performance circuit. He studied with some of the nation’s top jazz musicians including Pat LaBarbera, John Macleod, and Alistair Kay. Christian expanded his instrumental skills into bass trombone doubling and his musical proficiency as a contemporary jazz arranger/composer for combo and big band. On the stage, his dynamic performance abilities were obvious, playing a variety of styles from jazz to Latin to R&B. Christian was also featured on seven college-produced records as a member of the prestigious Humber Studio Jazz ensemble. Now living in Toronto, Christian’s career is gaining such momentum that it’s hard to keep up! He performs in a variety of ensembles regularly including the nine-piece funk band King Sunshine, The Toronto Jazz Orchestra, and most recently, The Art of Jazz Orchestra in addition to various other pit orchestras and jobbing bands. Christian is also the featured composer and musical director for The Composers Collective Big Band, a seventeen-piece ensemble performing high-energy, contemporary works that smash the traditions of the Toronto jazz scene. Christian can also be heard on television, writing material for various productions such as School of Chef and Sun TV’s, King Kaboom.",Beginner Level,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/the-music-coach-online-trombone-lesson-program/,True

744080,Piano With Willie: Tritones & Phat Chords,"So what is a tritone? Or a quartal? UST's...huh?
These are the techniques that advanced piano players use to create ""spicier"" chords and progressions. You know that super hip, rich sound? The techniques in this course show you how to get THAT sound.
I'm going to show you how to create these big, 'phat' chords, then show you how to apply them to a song. After that, you can then use these techniques on thousands of other jazz, blues, gospel and funk songs.
A tritone is a technique used to change the harmony (progression) of a song. This is a simplified version and we will go into much more detail in the lesson. But, by knowing this technique you can make songs sound more original and add your own signature sound to your arrangements.
Quartals are chords that are built in 4ths. By using this technique, your chords get an ""open"" sound which sounds modern and hip.
Next, when you add UST's (Upper Structure Triads) to your chords they POP with rich chordal goodness. It really is a superb sound.
In order to get the most from this course, make sure that you already know all of your basic Major, Minor and Dominant seventh chords.
These techniques in this course will also help you to improve your improvisation skills because playing these modern chords under your improvisation sounds really hip!",Intermediate Level,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/piano-with-willie-tritones-phat-chords/,True

131512,Inside Drum Technique,"Description of the course
The main aim of IDT is to show and to explain the processes necessary to go through in order to develop a technique that allows us to play in a relaxed, controlled and musical way.
Along these videos I will do my best to show in detail the physical sensations that can be experienced when starting to study the technique. To achieve this, I will do a careful analysis of every movement made.
I will place particular emphasis on the importance of passing through some stages which, in my opinion, are vital to acquire an effective hand drumming technique. I will show that by working in a constant and progressive way, with clear goals, it is possible to achieve tangible results and to avoid frustrations.
I want to share with you my belief that a constant thirst for knowledge and the feeling of satisfaction when developing news skills can lead to a creative way of studying our instruments.
The satisfaction of learning how to make a stroke comfortably will surely encourage us to keep on practicing to strive for perfection. This way we will reach more complex stages each time. As we become more confident and more curious we will feel more motivated to improve our technique and to practice regularly. Such practice should not be experienced as a dull and monotonous routine but as an opportunity to learn new things and to become better drummers, better musicians and better artists.
Mi chief aim is to encourage you to discover and experience this. If this happens, then this work has achieved its purpose.

Our conception about technique
To acquire a good technique does not mean becoming extremely virtuous only. It means having the ability to produce the right sound effect in a certain musical moment, as well. The more tools we have to create these effects, the better our technique and the richer our music.
To sum up, I believe studying in detail the technique allows us to express better when playing our instruments. Hence, we play in a more colorful and versatile way.
Although this guide is focused on studying and analyzing the technique, I firmly believe a good musician should develop its creativity and musical sense as well.
I think this work I am sharing with you would be worthless if its aim was not a musical one.
I insist on the fact that the technique should always serve music, for this is the only way it gains real value.

'INSTANT HARMONICA' is a new series of courses where you learn one tune per course. You will find it is taught in a friendly and encouraging manner and most importantly is it taught v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y.
Ben Hewlett is a very experienced music teacher who is able to be very patient and methodical. Each lecture will introduce you to the next group of notes – usually just 4 new notes and that's it.
This method is very easy for you to pick up the tunes as they are repeated over and over again until you have got it. You can even re-run the video if you find it useful.
Take one course and learn your favourite tune. The try another. Remember you can always get your money back if you wish but otherwise you have lifetime access to the course.
Imagine how amazing it will feel when you whip out your harmonica and play this tune – your friends and family will carry you shoulder high in triumph. Hopefully they don't carry you out of town and dump you in the river, but hey, swimming's good as well.
The health benefits of playing the harmonica are well documented – google it. Your lungs get exercised, your lung capacity increases, aerobic movement is good for you, playing music makes you smarter they say.
You will have fun on your own and with your friends, and more oxygen to the brain will make you think you are having a good time so it's all good.

1173716,Arpeggios for Guitar made Easy! Dominate the Fretboard,"Hey allGuitarJoolzhere and welcome to my latest course ""Arpeggios for Guitar made Easy"".Here you will find an easy way to learn arpeggios on guitar. Bystarting with triadsand building upon them and adding them slowly to you guitar playing with the aid of exercises and jam tracks.

Arpeggiosare basicallychord patterns where the notes are played separately. This makes them so useful and essential for learning chords in different positions along the guitar neck, for understanding what notes to target in a guitar solo and also for creating ear pleasing melodies and licks. You canlearn to play arpeggios all over the guitar neckmore easily than most think.

It is not a subject that can be covered in a 20 minute section of an ""all in one guitar course"". It's a whole course, hence this one is 3 hours long, coversmajor, minorand touches ondiminished/sevenths. I have carefully structured the course as you would in a ""real"" learning scenario, nothing is left out, there is no guess work and you will learn methodically, a little at a time until you fully understand the concepts. The subject is covered in total detail and you are also shown how to construct all of the patterns, with tab, note charts, interval charts, octave patterns, MP3jam tracksall on screen and with downloads too!

You'll be learning arpeggios that can be used for jazz, blues, rock, metal, pop etc

There aremany techniquesin the course, ones you will be able to apply musically;  triplet and quadruplets patterns, all major and minor patterns and their inversions up and down the neck in 3,4,5 note per string patterns (i don't just give you the shapes! You have astrict regimeto apply to a jam track that can be used in real life), arpeggio patterns following chord progressions,rocksoloing ideas,neo-classicaltechniques, sweeps and pedal points,jazzideas with passing tones, diminished and seventh shapes and also chordal ideas in the style of Rock and Pop bands such asRed Hot Chilli Peppers, Kings of Leon, Strokesetc.

If you are questioning, ""Is this course for me""? Well, it's for everyone, it assumes one has no knowledge of arpeggios at all and slowly shows all the steps needed to become advanced in their application. The course is not aimed solely atrockorjazzguitarists, its for everyone to apply these awesome techniques! Comprehensive explanations, clear examples, and slow breakdown(with on screen TAB and Standard Notation) infull HD closeupsmake it impossible not to have success!

This course is about the learner, not the instructor and i don't play a load of fancy licks to show off my skills and then say ""now you try after downloading a tab""! It'scomplete, structured and learner focussed.

Take this course if;

- You want to fully comprehendTRIADS,one of the most important building blocks of all guitar playing.

- You want to understand how toplay chords everywhereand want to be able to do it without the CAGED system.

- You don't know where to start with guitar soloing and melody creation andlearn to play arpeggios on guitar for both rhythm and leadwork.

- You are stuck in a rut with your playing and want to add some 'spice' to your licks.

- You want to understand the fundamentals ofsweep picked arpeggios.

- You can play arpeggios but don't know how to apply or construct anything with them.

- You simply want to learn some fancy licks!

- You play music that requires twin guitar parts

- You want to understand the concepts ofmusic harmony and triad construction.

- You likestructure, jam tracks, full taband a course thatactually feels like having private lessons from a time served and dedicated guitar teacher.

761938,Guitar Lessons - The Modal System - Modes Essentials,"If the concept of Modes seems like a mystery to you, this series of lessons, taught by top UK Session guitarists, Bobby Harrison and Nick Radcliffe, will give you a deep understanding of the modal system. If you already know the major scale, there’s a strong chance you may have already been using some of its modes without even knowing it.
You might have heard the names: Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian and Locrian. If not, you will certainly have heard their sounds on many popular songs. These are the modes of the major scale and although there are other more exotic modes from other scales, these seven are the most commonly used in modern music.
Learning how to use the modal system will open up a whole new realm of musical creativity.
Over the following lessons, Nick and Bobby break down the theory and applications of the Modal System step by step, giving you plenty of demo solos to inspire you, encouraging you to play along with the 7 backing tracks and come up with your own ideas. Later, Bobby and Nick show you how to incorporate pentatonic scales into your modal playing, giving you even more possibilities when soloing.",All Levels,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/guitar-lessons-the-modal-system-modes-essentials/,True

264396,Learn How to Play the Violin - Violin Basics,"This course will introduce students to the very basics of violin playing and music theory. It starts with learning the parts of the instrument itself, applying music to the violin, and finally teaching how to play the classic ""Twinkle Twinkle"". The terminology used will be explained in detail as the course progresses, and will be revisited throughout. This course is very video-intensive, with occasional power-points to emphasise certain material to help students achieve full understanding of the music theory covered in the class. The actual course will take about a week to accomplish. This time depends on how much time the student will devote to practicing the material outside of the actual video training. The course is structured in two sections. The first incorporates learning about the bow hold, the violin hold, proper positions, and bowing techniques. The second will focus on beats, in-depth music theory, and scales.
Learning an instrument is a fun way to exercise your creative muscles and the violin presents a challenge, but not a difficult challenge. The violin is a very diverse instrument. It can be played in the most beautiful symphonies, and can also transition into bluegrass music. Anyone who wants to learn violin at their own pace will excel during this course, as it will teach them all the basics they will need on their way to becoming a great violinist.",Beginner Level,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/violin-basics/,True

You´ll start of with the basics like the names of the keys, how meters work, fingering, tempos,how to use the pedal, etc. Then you´ll move on to learn songs in three “steps” starting with melodies in the right hand, adding bassnotes in the left and finally put chords to the songs. This will be based on a system which I call ”the sing-and-play-way”, meaning that you should first learn to sing the music, then sing and play it, THEN play it without singing it. In this way you will learn to “sing” with you instrument which according to me is the absolute best and most effective way. Wouldn't it be great if you could play all the songs that you can sing??
You will also learn scales, about  a lot of different chords and how to practice them, and also the wonderful pianostyles of stridepiano(jazz from the 30´s) and salsa!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Down below follows some important tips for ANYONE interested in learning how to play. I hope that you´ll find this useful! :)
1. THE MOST COMMON MISTAKE is to believe that music comes from your fingers playing. The music comes from inside of you and COMES OUT through your fingers.
2. YOU CAN AVOID THIS MISTAKE by three simple steps: 1: Sing, 2: Sing & play 3: Play.
3. ONE OF THE BIGGEST SECRETS is actually very easy. Always notice where you're going and prepare yourself for the next step. I talk about this in the presentation video (free). Don't miss out, this is so important.
4. THE WAY TO PRACTICE THAT NO ONE TALKS ABOUT is to practice ""backwards"". It might sound strange at first, but not if you think about it. If you're practicing starting from the beginning all the time, what will you learn best? The beginning of course! But as the song goes on you get more and more insecure. Start to practice the end of the song (or the end of the part that you want to learn) first. You will learn the beginning anyway, for sure. This is how most students waist their time, including myself once.
5. TAKE A COURSE ONLINE
Ok, this might sound a little bit cheesy coming from me, being the creator of this course. But I sincerely believe that this kind of teaching is the future. It has so many advantages in the possibilities to watch the videos over and over, the visual aspect and the ability to bring the lessons to you whenever you want and where you want.
Well, that was some advices from me. I hope that I´ll see you in the course!
Take care! :)

This course is a follow up to my best-selling ""Walking Bass - Quick Start Guide"" course. In this course I'll take you further and you'll learn how to strategically compose cool sounding walking bass lines from scratch. Yes - you will be COMPOSING and IMPROVISING on your OWN! By the end of the course, I guarantee that you'll be able to do it! In this course, I'll show you a strategic and simple way to construct and improvise walking bass lines right there on the spot using chord tones and different intervals. The concepts are easy to understand and it's something all bass pros know about, but rarely share. It took me years to figure out what I'm about to show you, and you'll be able to learn it in just a few weeks of practice. You'll then have a new bass skill that will stay with you forever and you'll be proud of it - I'm sure.
Please watch the free preview videos to get a taste for what’s inside.
This course is shot in HD video and features quality bass playing audio mixed with the backing tracks. The course is split into eight chapters, each adding a new note to our ""easy walking bass"" strategy. This means that each chapter is very doable - you just need a bit of practice but you'll understand concepts involved immediately.

This is why I'd like to encourage you tosend me messagesanytime, I’ll be checking them out and responding quickly (usually the same day!). Also, I’d like to ask you to record audio files or videos (you can post videos on Youtube and share the link) and send them to me forfeedback.
I’m here to help YOU, so please don’t be shy :)
This course is designed as a walking bass fundamentals tutorial. We won’t be going into any complicated theory and walking bass concepts - I'll just show you stuff that you really have to know to be able to enjoy walking bass. You'll learn walking bass essentials and basics. Everything else, when it comes to walking bass, just builds up on this foundation that you'll gain. I'll show you fundamentals that'll enable you to enjoy walking bass as a playing style and unlock your improvisation ability on bass. Walking bass sounds impressive, so this is an amazing skill to have. There is no magic behind it, rather simple ideas and strategies that you can apply immediately to understand which notes can you play over which chords.
This course, does not rely on music theory much. You'll learn some theory related concepts such as intervals that you have to know in order to enjoy walking bass, but I tried to skip theory that you don't actually need as much as possible. This is a problem of many other walking bass courses out there, as those just dig too deep into music theory that it becomes boring too soon. You’ll just need to have a very basic understanding of how to find certain notes on the fretboard (in basic, most often used positions on the neck) and be able to play quarter notes steadily. Since walking bass heavily relies on chords, you’ll need to have a basic understanding of chords and root notes, but we cover those topics within the course so you can just dig into it and ask me questions along the way if something is not clear.
Please send me your feedback about the course. What did you like? What did you not like? How could I improve it? Your feedback means a lot to me and I need to in order to better shape the course content for YOU.

32033,Aprende batería con el nuevo método IDT,"El objetivo de IDT es mostrarles y explicarles el desarrollo de los procesos que es necesario atravesar para construir una técnica de manos que les permita tocar relajadamente, controladamente y sobre todo musicalmente.
Durante esta serie de videos haré mi mayor esfuerzo por transmitirles detalladamente las distintas sensaciones físicas que posiblemente experimenten al empezar a estudiar dicha técnica, para esto plantearé un análisis minucioso de cada movimiento realizado.Haré hincapié en lo imprescindible de atravesar ciertas etapas que, desde mi perspectiva, son fundamentales en la búsqueda de una sostenida evolución hacia una sólida técnica de manos. Para esto les mostraré que realizando un trabajo constante y creciente, y trazándose metas concretas es posible evitar frustraciones prematuras y lograr resultados tangibles.Quiero compartir con ustedes mi convicción de que el afán por el constante aprendizaje y la búsqueda del placer en la adquisición de nuevas destrezas, pueden ser fundamentales impulsores hacia un hábito de estudio creativo sobre nuestro instrumento.Experimentar la satisfacción de pasar de no saber cómo ejecutar determinado golpe, o hacerlo con dificultad, a poder realizarlo, seguramente nos aliente a seguir practicando para tratar de repetir esta experiencia de superación, la cual se irá dando a niveles que presentarán cada vez mayor complejidad.Es así que nuestra curiosidad y la confianza de que podemos lograr cosas que parecían imposibles, nos llevará a querer seguir mejorando y a incorporar el hábito de practicar. Este hábito no debemos planteárnoslo como una rutina aburrida y tediosa sino como un continuo intento de aprender nuevas cosas y de superarnos como bateristas, como músicos y como artistas.Mi mayor intención es motivarlos a que descubran y experimenten esto. Si así ocurre, este trabajo habrá alcanzado el fin propuesto.
Nuestra concepción sobre la técnica
Para muchas de las personas que hacemos música, tener buena técnica no significa únicamente ser extremadamente virtuosos, sino que está más ligado a la idea de tener la capacidad de lograr el efecto sonoro deseado en un determinado momento musical; cuántas más herramientas tengamos para generar estos efectos, mejor técnica tendremos y más rica será nuestra música.En definitiva, creo que estudiar en profundidad la técnica de un instrumento nos permite enriquecer nuestros medios de expresión sobre el mismo, haciendo más versátil y colorido lo que tocamos.Aunque esta guía se centre en el estudio y análisis de la técnica, estoy convencido de que un buen músico debe desarrollarla interrelacionadamente con su creatividad y su musicalidad.Siento que de nada sirve lo que comparto con ustedes si no tiene un fin musical.Insisto en que la técnica debe estar siempre al servicio de la música, es de esta manera que adquiere real valor.

This is PART 2.
I recommend you take 'Instant Bodhran - part one; learn the basics of drumming now' BEFORE taking this course.

'INSTANT BODHRAN' is a new course where you learn one simple idea per lecture. You will find it is taught in a friendly and encouraging manner and most importantly is it taught v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y.
'Ben Hewlett is a very experienced music teacher who is able to be very patient and methodical. Each lecture will introduce you to the next rhythm or technique – usually just one new idea and that's it.
You'll know Ben better as a harmonica teacher but he studied Bodhrah and tin whistle in the 1990's with the now very famous Steafan Hannigan and Marc Moggy from Renegade Rhythms. He got so into Bodhran he bought an expensive tuneable drum from Marc and it works better than ever to this day. Ben has played Bodhran in bands and sessions for years and even has a Senheiser bass drum microphone embedded into his drum.
Ben is an experienced teacher and uses his skills to get the message across to you in a clear and concise way.'
This method is very easy for you to pick up the rhythms and strokes as they are repeated over and over again until you have got it. You can even re-run the video if you find it useful.
Imagine how amazing it will feel when you whip out your bodhran and play this tune – your friends and family will carry you shoulder high in triumph. Hopefully they don't carry you out of town and dump you in the river, but hey, swimming's good as well.

Each lecture is designed to teach you the trumpet notes and tones as well as key fingering and mouth pressure for each one.
As you progress through each lesson you will gain confidence in reading, listening and remembering the fingering as well as observe the patterns and progressions of each note.
Each lecture or tutorial includes a fingering chart to highlight each lesson's focus and will help you to observe the musical patterns both visually as well as listening to each tone or scale. We give you tips along the way as well as a simple quiz to ensure  your comprehension and retention is high.
You can also ask questions to ensure  that your can maximize your learning. We are happy to also receive feedback in ways to improve the Passive Trumpet Tutor to benefit your fellow students and trumpet enthusiasts.
You will learn where each note sits on the staff, what they sound like, which notes are associated with what fingers also referred to overtone positions and the combination of fingerings with embouchure pressure which we refer to here as positions.
Depending how advanced you are we have designed the course so that you can repeat each lecture several times a week before continuing. This course is designed for you to watch a trumpet practice drill and should reflect some of your practice sessions.

720072,Hands On Guitar: Beyond Beginner,"You already know how to tune a guitar. You already know several open position chords and maybe a couple of moveable barre chord shapes. You know a few strumming or picking patterns, can keep fairly good time, and have a small handful of easy songs under your belt. You can even play a few single note lines and licks. But you just can’t seem to take your playing to the next level…
Welcome to the club! Everyone who has ever picked up the guitar has been exactly where you are. Crossing that bridge between beginner and intermediate player is one of the biggest challenges we face as guitarists. There’s plenty of beginning guitar instruction and plenty of intermediate guitar instruction available, but there’s almost nothing that bridges the gap between them. That’s why Susan Mazer’s Beyond Beginner is your express ticket, over that bridge, to the bountiful and very musical world of intermediate guitar!
Susan has organized the Beyond Beginner course into eight sections, Each section contains a series of lessons focused on an essential skill you’ll need to cross your bridge to go beyond beginner…
“I’m going to help you develop the eight essential skills you’ll need to go beyond beginner. You’ll expand your open chord vocabulary to the 25 chords needed to play thousands of songs. You’ll learn how to use chord substitutions, extensions and embellishments. We’ll work on movable barre chord forms so you can play any of your tunes all over the neck. You’ll learn 30 strumming and picking patterns so that you can choose the perfect groove for any song. I’ll show you how to incorporate bass lines and slash chords in your playing. You’ll learn how to hold your own in any blues jam. You’ll learn how to solo a little and play a few single line fills. And finally, I’ll teach you how to play songs in any key to best match the singer.”
Your first stop on Susan’s bullet train will populate your chord vocabulary with all of the chords that you hear being played in your favorite songs but just haven't found on your fretboard yet. You’ll learn how form the Major 7th, Minor 7th and Dominant 7th chords that are so popular across almost every genre of music.
You second stop introduces you to those cool Sus4, Sus2, Add9 and 6th chords that all of your favorite singer-songwriters use all of the time. You’ll also learn how to use embellishments like hammer-ons and pull-offs while strumming chords to add even more interest to your rhythm playing.
All aboard and onto your third stop where Susan passes on the fretboard magic of moveable barre chords — your gateway to using the entire neck of the guitar for both rhythm playing and soloing. Even if you already play a few moveable barre chords, tune in here for more insight!
Learning 30 new strumming and picking patterns is next: 10 strumming patterns in 4/4 time, 10 strumming patterns in 3/4 time and 10 finger-picking patterns in 4/4 time. You’ll never be at a loss again to come up with an appropriate rhythm guitar part with these 30 patterns at you fingertips.
Next stop, Slash chords and Bass lines. Susan will show you how to incorporate slash chords and bass lines in your playing to create more textures and movement in your rhythm guitar parts.
Grab your electric guitar for the next stop as you learn to play and jam on the blues (although you can use electric or acoustic for any of the lessons and skills being taught in this course). The 12-bar blues is probably the most frequently played progression in contemporary music. Susan will show you a few different ways to play rhythm guitar parts for the 12-bar blues and also give you the tools to play it in any key.
Just two stops to go! On this stop, its time to start playing a little lead guitar. Susan shows you how to solo using movable and sliding major and minor pentatonic scales — the most important scales in popular music. You’ll also learn to add a few riffs to your rhythm playing.
On the last stop across the bridge, Susan ices the cake of your new musicality with a series of lessons focused on identifying keys and tonal centers, and how to approach changing keys to best match the singer’s voice, whether that’s you or the singer in your band.
You’ll play your way through the course, applying all of the skills as soon as you learn them by working with the playalongs and jam tracks that Susan prepared for the course. Susan also includes lots of charts and diagrams, and many of the examples will also be tabbed and notated, plus you’ll also get all of the rhythm tracks to work with on your own.

“I’ve learned more in 4 months with [Lauren] than I have in 2 years with in person instruction.”— Joanne Inzinna“I started the course about four months ago and cannot get over how far I have come in so short a period of time. I’ve gone from knowing absolutely nothing to being able to play “Country Roads,” “Horse With No Name,” and “Eleanor Rigby.”— Daryl Holmes“I’d had trouble with other online lessons not showing fingering or strum patterns clearly, but Lauren breaks it down to the very simplest steps that things just really began to click with me. I started lessons with her about 3 months ago and I led worship at church this week for the first time playing my acoustic guitar. I would have never dreamed success would come so quickly!”— Pamela Yates
“When I turned 60, I wanted to take guitar lessons. I signed up for classes at a well-known music store. Four instructors, two music schools and two years later, I didn’t feel like I had learned very much. As each instructor moved on, each new instructor taught in a different style and I always felt like I was starting from square one. I decided to try to learn on my own with YouTube. I came across some videos by Lauren Bateman. After watching a few videos and seeing what I liked, I signed up for Lauren’s online classes. I love them. She is a great instructor, very patient and very concise. Her course is laid out very well and I love Lauren’s videos. They are easy to understand and easy to follow along with. I would highly recommend Lauren Bateman’s online course.”- Lori Bennet

Lauren's teaching is very different the other guitar teachers online, probably because she doesn't have a degree in music. Just like you, Lauren picks up the guitar so she could have fun playing the songs she loves and that's how she teaches.

Use this material as:
Thecourse comfortably niches all the relevant material from the first months of lessons into one product.Used as a series of lessons, a beginner can take anywhere from 3-6 months to complete the content. During section 8, students are told to pause the material, and use supplementary exercises to strengthen their embouchure muscles and current reading ability before moving on to the next stage – it is important to allow the playing to evolve. There is an emphasis on measuring progress, not by the number of notes learnt or the number of tunes played, but by the quality of the tone produced and by the ease of the execution of that sound.
The terminology of the notation is both American and English. Literacy skills are taught with the note values from Whole Tone/Semibreves through to Eighth Note/Quavers. The notes studied are the natural ones from low F, below the stave (in the low/chalumeaux register), to A in the throat register, plus Throat Bb, F sharp on the first space and low Bb.

This 14-part series of lessons, taught by top UK session guitarist, Bobby Harrison, is the third instalment of our Blues Guitar series. We’ve learned how to solo over both a shuffle groove and a slow blues progression, but now it’s time to turn our attention to minor blues playing.
The focus here is how to solo over minor or minor 7th chords, as opposed to the dominant 7th progressions we’ve grown accustomed to. There are several differences in both mood and note choice, especially since we no longer have the luxury of mixing both the major and minor pentatonic scales; and as for our old friend, the major third, avoid that fella like the plague when soloing over a minor blues progression!
We will learn a mean 36-bar solo, containing countless blues licks that you can incorporate into your own playing, as well as a cool, ZZ Top inspired minor blues rhythm guitar part.

""Practical Guitar Theory"" gives a comprehensive foundation to music theory on Guitar. This course contains the most useful and essential theory knowledge for guitar enthusiasts, and will demonstrate how to APPLY the knowledge in your daily playing. This course is tailored for people who have little to intermediate theory understanding. Perhaps you already have some basics but you find yourself lost, or you really want some structure and goals in your learning process. Whether you have zero theory knowledge, or you feel like there are many gaps in your current understanding,this course has you covered!

Why should you listen to me?
I have 11 years of experience which is really hard for me to condense into a single paragraph, but allow me highlight some key points...


So how will these key points benefit me?
I realise that not everyone has the opportunity or money to watch the musicians I have mentioned above play live - let alone take lessons with them! I am also aware that there is no obvious and easy route to guitar mastery. With these points in mind, I have taken my knowledge and experience, and crafted it into guided, easy to follow video lessons. This course is genuinely something I wish I discovered in my earlier days of playing the guitar.

What makes this course any better than free YouTube lessons?
It can take so much effort and time searching through the web to find the relevant and correct information that you need to improve your guitar playing. YouTube is an incredibly useful tool, but it's very easy to become overwhelmed and lost.
This course will make your learning process much more structured and engaging, and it's exclusively tailored towards guitar theory! With my years of experience and array of positive testimonials and comments from my students, and on my youtube videos, you can be certain that I know what I'm talking about. Don't waste time sifting through lessons that may not be teaching you the right or relevant things -""Practical Guitar Theory"" is what you've been looking for.

Ok I'm interested, but what exactly does this course entail?
A lot! Let me give you an overview of the sections...

Still not sure?
If you buy the course and it turns out that you already knew this stuff, or you believe that it's way beyond your understanding at this moment in time, then take advantage of the 30 day money back guarantee. I do believe that this course is very thorough and easy to follow, but if you find yourself struggling at all then don't hesitate to get in touch! I amVERYresponsive. If you have a question, would like me to expand on a lecture, or have any feedback for improvements, then I really encourage you to let me know.

615226,"Play Leyenda, Canarios, and Bach on Classical Guitar","This course is all about helping you realize your potential as a classical guitarist as you learn to play 3 great pieces from the classical guitar repertoire,Canarios,Gavottes 1 and2, andLeyenda. You’ll follow a step-by-step course that shows you the most beneficial way to practice scales, how to use technical exercises, and how to play the 3 pieces at a performance standard.
What you can expect to get out of the course
Your main goal for the course is to play 3
pieces from the classical guitar repertoire,Canarios,Gavottes
1and 2, andLeyenda.The premise of the
course is that you'll have much more success if you thoughtfully prepare before
jumping into the pieces.
Playing the classical guitar is such a
multi-sensory experience, and a video-based course is a great way to learn at
your own pace. You know that there are no shortcuts, but by following a logical
course that starts easy and gradually gets more challenging your experience will
be much easier and rewarding.
Classical guitar is beautiful and complex, but
that complexity can be intimidating, so in this course every musical phrase
will be broken into a manageable piece that's easy to work with, and easy to
put back into the whole of the piece.
The course starts with some brief introductory
lectures that review the basics of the classical guitar approach, and then
moves into scales. You'll customize your scale practice so that you're ready
for each piece. It would be good to have some experience playing higher up on the fret-board, but you'll review the notes on the fret-board in the scales section, so you're prepared for everything that follows. Next, you'll start playing technical exercises
that are unique to this course to prepare you for the piece that you'll be
playing.
The lectures show the hands from a variety of angles, and in the lecture
descriptions you can find the time where each camera angle changes. The
lectures on the pieces start with a small chunk played up to speed, then a slow
walk-through the notes, followed by a more in-depth lesson on each hand.
You'll also get downloadable PDF files of
every scale, exercise, and piece, so not only will you receive a  full score of
""Leyenda"" and the other pieces that are in the course, but you'll have a clear view of
how to play every single note. This course doesn't contain any guitar
tablature, but remember that you will be able to see and hear every last note
in the course in the video lectures.
I hope you'll continue your journey with this
course by clicking the button that says ""Start Learning Now"" and
enrolling in the course and enjoying lifetime access to the lecture videos and
sheet music files. Thanks for reading and I wish you the best with your guitar
playing.",Intermediate Level,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/play-leyenda-canarios-and-bach-on-classical-guitar/,True

1160066,Classical Guitar Technique: 80/20,"The title of this course refers to the fact that when you are learning a new skill, 80% of your results will come from 20% of your efforts. The key then is to spend as much time on that 20%. With an art form like classical guitar there aren't any shortcuts, but the problem is that too many people take that to mean that you should struggle and not make progress for a long time. Something I see in lessons is that certain bad habits get reinforced, so that even with lots of practice time there isn't much improvement.
This course is laser-focused on the skills that are essential to being a good classical guitarist. These skills aren't flashy, in fact if you are executing them correctly your audience probably won't be aware of what's going on. And that's what you want, since you want people to focus on themusic,that's what people mean when they make the distinction between someone who is aguitar playerand someone who is amusician.
That sounds pretty good, but how do you do that? It's essential to spend the limited time and energy you have for guitar practicing in the best way. To that end, you'll focus on techniques and concepts that have 3 key characteristics:
That being said, this course isn't meant for absolute beginners. As long as you have some basic experience playing guitar and plucking the strings with your right-hand fingers, you are going to find a lot of good stuff to work on this course. There are over a dozen short study pieces written specifically for this course that will help you build your technique in 3 key areas: right hand technique, left hand technique, and transitions.
At the end of the course you'll be able to apply everything you've learned by playing the ""Minuet in G"" by J.S. Bach. As always you'll have lifetime access to the lesson videos as well as downloadable PDF files of the study pieces and the Minuet written in both standard notes and guitar tablature.
There's a great quote by Abraham Lincoln, ""If you give me 6 hours to chop down a tree, I will spend the first four sharpening the axe."" Your technique is your axe and this course will help you sharpen it so that you can make the most progress. The longer I teach classical guitar lessons, the more convinced that anyone can play the classical guitar well. If you are serious about becoming a good classical player, then you'll really enjoy working through the lessons, learning the study pieces, and becoming a better musician.
This is a video lesson-based course, with each lesson video lasting about 10 minutes and showing the hands from a variety of angles. The heart of the course is a set of 13 original classical guitar study pieces, as well as the Minuet in G by J.S.Bach. Each study includes a downloadable PDF file of the sheet music written in both standard notation and guitar tablature, and once you enroll you'll have lifetime access to the lesson videos.

625974,Total beginner to intermediate guitar - Learn to play by ear,"Are you beginning the guitar? OR.....
Have you been playing the guitar for a while, but feel that you are ""stuck""?
Look no further if you not only want to become a guitar player but also a better musician.
In my many years of playing guitar and teaching, I have seen beginning guitar players get led astray because of a lack of foundation. People who pick up the guitar sometimes rush toward playing their favorite song or learning a solo with tabs. Although, there is nothing wrong with this, I have often seen that it can lead to discouragement and/or a poor interpretation of music. People end up playing bits and pieces of melodies and can rarely play any song from beginning to end. Or they have a poor sense of rhythm and this makes it hard to play with others. They becomeclosetguitar players because the music only sound right to them.
Other people learn a bunch of chords to songs and are incapable of playing any melodies.
This course is here to fix all this.
Get you off on the right foot by getting a solid foundation in melody. After a short while, you will start to hear the melody within you as you are playing. Just play along with the videos and don't be afraid of starting videos again from the start.
The lessons are divided by string groups. The first lessons include melodies that can be played using only the first two strings of the guitar! From there, each new section introduces a new string. There are also sections that teach chord strumming, fingerpicking and advanced tuning.
Here's a breakdown course's sections:
The aim of this course is to get you to play by ear with the help of the video lessons. The format is the same throughout the course. First you will see an example of the melody or exercise you are going to learn. The following video is the lesson that teaches you the melody. This way, once you are learning, you will already have the music in you ears. All you have to do is make your fingers interpret what you are hearing. Then, you can go back to the previous video once your music is up to speed.
You see, it is possible to have the same mindset of some of the greatest musicians right from the start. All the greatest musicians have one thing in common; they are playing what they are hearing.
This course will teach you to do exactly that and more! Don't feel that you need tablatures or sheet music in order to play music. Just watch and learn and you will be amazed at what happens in a short period of time.

The aim is for you to immediately be able to use the theory practically and creatively in your own playing and writing
Study Pop And Jazz Keyboards and Really Understand How The Music Works
Play many different kinds of chords (triads and sevenths) in both hands,
Use chords in chord progressions, and understand how they work
Play chords in inversions and play chord progressions smoothly
Learn how to write a chord progression
Write effective and interesting melodies to chords
Learn about left-hand Bass-lines and The Blues
Learn and Play Like a Working Pop or Jazz Musician
Learning to play keyboards can be an end in itself, but is also a great way to understand how music works, an aim of this course.
Instead of learning set, notated pieces, you’ll be using the keyboard to play and study chords, progressions and other harmonic-elements, learning how they work together. Then, apply this to your playing so that you improve not just your keyboard-playing, but can develop skills vital to the pop and jazz keyboardist.
That could include playing from a chord-chart in a band; creating an accompaniment to a singer; making keyboard arrangements using chord-symbols; writing songs and keyboard music, jamming, and starting to improvise and solo.
Many working pop and jazz musicians learned to perfect the same skills in the same way, all things that require as good an understanding of Practical Harmony as possible.
Content and Overview
The course has 12 lessons and 2.75 hours of video, starting with basic concepts and progressing through more sophisticated ones in a logical way. The aim is to keep playing ability in line with what has been learned theoretically.
The first few lessons explain simple chord-types  that can be found in different keys, also how these work together to create strong chord-progressions. Later, you’ll learn to play them in different shapes, enabling smooth playing of progressions.
Subsequently, you’ll study richer, more advanced four-note seventh chords, and what they can do within a chord-progression.
In the final few lessons, you’ll branch out to explore how right-hand melodies relate to the left-hand accompanying chords, and what are the components of a melody. Then, how a left-hand bass-line (or one played by a bassist) relates to a chord progression and in general the different types there are.
Lastly, you’ll study how a Blues works, a musical-form that exists in many styles and one which, in a clear way, brings together all the different topics studied in the course.
Please note: “Pop” as used in the course-title is a loose-term  for many possible styles, e.g.  rock, country, r&b etc. “Jazz”, similarly.
Theory-content is stated succinctly, and accompanied by keyboard demonstrations. How chords can be used in a typical progression is always shown.Details spoken are reinforced by written text, and lessons conclude with a “practice” segment listing things to work on.
The Beginner level course is part of a larger course, including Intermediate and Advanced levels (not yet published), structured in the same way.

In this course, you will learn why a moment in a song will sound beautiful and unique because, instead of a plain major or minor chord, the composer used a ""2"" chord, or a ""sus"" chord, or maybe a ""dim"" chord. If you don't know what those symbols mean, you can't get the exact sound of the song that you were hoping for.
In simple language and easy-to-follow visual examples, you will learn how to play the special additions and variations to major and minor chords that often pop up in music today. You'll also learn how to use these variations to make your own playing style more interesting.

101504,Blues Guitar Lessons - Ragtime Blues Guitar,"Alternating Bass And Ragtime Blues GuitarRagtime piano became popular in the early 1900s and some blues guitar players realized that the characteristic bass signature could be played in a simplified way on the guitar. To accomplish this, it was necessary to strike two or three bass strings with the picking thumb, alternating between the strings, producing a bum-chick sound. When this technique was combined with the picking sounds of the fingers, a very complex sound is produced which sounds like two guitars!Many guitarists, such as Mississippi John Hurt, used this technique exclusively and recorded some fine work - he is one of the artists we take a look at in this course.The dexterity needed to play this style is far above that required to play monotonic, delta style blues.  Blind Blake was probably the foremost ragtime blues guitar player between 1920 and 1930. He achieved this by taking the thumb control to a new, extraordinary level.In many of his songs, Blake doubled up on the alternating thumb beats, making two notes instead of one. Blake's work is covered in another of my courses.I've presented 6 video lessons demonstrating the techniques of some great guitar players who were experts at playing ragtime style syncopated guitar songs - John Hurt, Pink Anderson, Willie Walker, Blind Boy Fuller and  Blind Willie McTell. These guys laid the foundations of the style and provided the foundation for later master guitar pickers such as Merle Travis, Doc Watson, Chet Atkins and Tommy Emmanuel. Modern players took hold of this early ragtime sound and quickly extended the chords and techniques, exploring new areas. Many of the original Scott Joplin rags have been faithfully transcribed, and other ways of playing appeared constantly. In the U.S., many notable musicians extended these picking styles and gave the music a country flavor.

721202,Guitar 201: Breakthroughs,"YES, you’re in the right place! How do we know that? Because the very fact that you’re reading this course description says a a lot about you…
You’ve always wanted to play guitar and so you bought one or received one as a gift. You picked up a couple of beginner’s courses or had a friend give you a few tips. You put in the time to learn a few chords and a strum or two. But you still can't play your favorite songs or jam with your buds. You’re frustrated because you’re still a beginner, and not yet a player.
Statistically, only 7% of the people who set out to learn guitar have the conviction to get as far as you have (the vast majority quit before they even learn three chords). So, congrats to you! Now, the only thing keeping you from graduating from beginner to guitar player is desire (we know you have that!) and the right course of study.

632488,Spice up your playing with some easy Flamenco techniques! ,"Flamenco is a genre of music and dance native to the southern region of Spain referred to as Andelusia. The genre features percussive dance, hand clapping and finger snapping. The guitar style encompasses all this by the use of a myriad of right and left hand techniques.
The songs and dances of flamenco music originated among the gypsy people of southern Spain, and it is now familiar all over the world. It has gained immense popularity in certain regions. Astoundingly enough, there are more flamenco academies in Japan than there are in Spain. Here is your opportunity to tap into the rich heritage of the Flamenco style of guitar playing, wherever you may be in the world.
This course is meant to familiarize you with flamenco techniques on the classical guitar. You will learn the essential techniques of flamenco guitar playing that you can apply to your current style of playing or use as a stepping stone for further study of flamenco guitar. For example, you could play a song like ""Freight Train"" in a rhumba rhythm that you learn in this course. It would be the same song, just a little spicier!
You will learn the following techniques in this course:
You can take a free five minute preview of this course. You will see inside that all the lessons are done in two parts. The first video is a performance of the technique. The second is a tutorial where Jay your instructor explains the technique and shows you exactly how to do it. The videos feature separate views of the right and left hand so you won't have trouble seeing what he's playing. The video player that is used for this course is awesome. It lets you slow down the speed of the video to 50% without changing the pitch.

These chords are a ""must have"" for any piano player, regardless of style.

Piano chords are important because they provide the harmonic foundation for many types of music, from classical to pop. They add richness, depth, and complexity to a musical piece, and can convey different emotions and moods depending on the chord progression used. Chords also allow a piano player to accompany other musicians or themselves while singing, and can serve as a tool for songwriting and improvisation.

In addition to their musical functions, piano chords are important because they can help develop a player's technical and aural skills. Practicing chords can improve finger dexterity, hand coordination, and overall playing fluency. Learning to identify and play different types of chords can also enhance a musician's ability to recognize and replicate different harmonic patterns, which is a crucial skill for music composition and arrangement.

Moreover, piano chords are an essential part of music theory, which is the study of the principles and elements of music. Understanding how chords are constructed and how they function within a piece of music is fundamental to understanding music theory. By studying and analyzing chords, musicians can gain a deeper appreciation and understanding of the music they play and listen to.

521440,The Essentials of Acoustic Guitar Strumming Patterns,"Most guitarists suck at strumming. Yes, they are awful.
Why? Bad teachers, bad learning habits and bad information. They are not taught the proper ways to strum, they lack technique, they don`t understand rhythm and worst of all they don`t know that this is holding them back. All this all leads to a LOT of wasted years with the guitar and a lack of confidence when they are playing and strumming it.
Using our video lessons, supplementary guide and killer bonuses you can now learn how to strum with complete confidence and gain an insider understands of rhythm and all in a short space of time.
You will be able to play the most common strum patterns in popular music which means along with a few chords you will be able to learn, play and impress others with 10,000`s of classic songs as well as write your own with ease.
Save hundreds of hours trying to work strum patterns out for yourself
Imagine being able to listen to a song, either find or workout the chords, hear the strum pattern and realize that you already know how to play this strum pattern, and then learn it in minutes just by listening to it.
Well, now you can, because in this course that`s what I take you through.
Most songs use just a select few (8 in fact) strumming patterns, a bunch of simple chords (which you are taught in this course)
Learn why most people's strumming sound dead (and what to do instead)
Well, I`ll tell you, apart from the lack of technique, dynamics, expression, subtlety and rhythm, which you will master in this course, it`s their inability to play with feel.
One key element every guitarist from George Harrison to Kurt Cobain, from Jimi Hendrix to Ed Sheeran has is a great sense of feel.
Most mere mortals don`t get past level 1 here, but I will teach you a simple little trick that can help add a sophisticated sense of feel and soul into ANY strum pattern you will ever learn.
Time is precious, and the guitar takes many, many years to truly master. Perfect this one fundamental element today – the crucial element of strumming and you can kick start your guitar playing to the next level allowing you to go on and be the guitar guru you desire to be.
""The fretting hand is the brain, the strumming hand is the soul.""
So much of our passion as guitarists come from the strumming hand.
Listen to the like of Damien Rice and Ed Sheeran to hear what I mean. The fretting hand doesn`t do a lot apart from the basic most of the time.
With these guys, the strumming hand takes these competent sounding basics and turbo charges them into a powerhouse of guitar wizardry - the sound of a soulful, heartened guitar player who is bearing is his soul for the world to hear.
You can just feel the passion, sorrow, joy and love oozing out of these guitarists hands.
You will learn how to apply this and so much more.

If you were guaranteed to save hundreds of wasted hours searching YouTube, discovering these techniques for yourself or paying $1000`s dollar in lessons, what that be worth to you?
I have vast knowledge of teaching the guitar, and I guarantee once you have mastered these materials, you will have far more confidence performing in front of friends, family members, college parties, at gigs, open mic night and even jam sessions.
You will be able to write songs far more ease, and you will impress yourself and others with your strumming skills!
Each video is short, in-depth and packed full of real, practical information.

I will show you:
The videos follow a carefully designed order to help you improve quickly. The course is divided into sections, the first dealing with improving your rhythm by introducing more complex strumming patterns using various songs while also introducing new chords. The next section gets you started reading TAB and learning the basics of finger-style guitar. And the final section takes a look at some more advanced techniques such as hammer-ons and pull-offs.
During the videos any chords that are  being used will appear onscreen and there are video inlays to give you a  closer look at what my left-hand fingers are doing. For lessons on finger-style and picking there are also video inlays that will show you a close-up of the right hand. A visual  representation of the strumming patterns and for finger-style songs TAB will also be shown onscreen  where necessary.
The strumming patterns and chord sequences are included as supplemental materials so they can be  downloaded and studied separately from the videos.
The course should take approx. 10-15weeks to complete but that will depend on the amount of time you are able to dedicate to practicing the guitar. If you can only practice for an hour at the weekend it could take considerably longer than if you can practice on a more regular basis.

199500,Play Autumn Leaves' falling notes on piano with no reading!,"Have you ever wondered if you could play the running descending passage of the most popular piano version of ""Autumn Leaves?""
In 1955, a rather unknown pianist by the name of Louis Jacob Weertz changed his name to Roger Williams and recorded his own arrangement of the somewhat popular ""Les Feuilles Mortes,"" soon to be known as ""Autumn Leaves."" It became the only piano instrumental to reach #1 on Billboard's Popular Music chart, and having sold over two million copies then, it was awarded a Gold Disc.
In 2010, Roger Williams was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. At that time, ""Autumn Leaves"" was the best-selling piano solo record of all time and the only one ever to top the Billboard charts. The following year, one week after his 87th birthday, he died after a long bout with pancreatic cancer.
This is the most famous piano arrangement of ""Autumn Leaves."" Roger Williams, nicknamed ""Mr. Piano"" by his international fans, created this piano riff that had made him famous worldwide. This is what you will be learning in this tutorial.
What you will find here is a unique approach to teaching pianists how to play the rippling sound of ""Autumn Leaves,"" Roger Williams' most famous recording.
Included are video lectures that show detailed instructions on how to properly play this amazing passage.

Are you ready to dive deep into the world of blues music and set your harmonica on fire with soulful melodies? Playing blues on the harmonica is an electrifying and expressive experience that will transport you to the heart and soul of this captivating genre. So, let's get started with some essential tips to ignite your blues harmonica journey!
First things first, you need the right tool for the job. Opt for a diatonic harmonica in the key of C. Why C, you ask? Well, my blues-savvy friend, the key of C is the go-to choice for playing blues. It harmonizes effortlessly with other instruments and allows you to jam with fellow musicians with ease. Consider it the secret weapon in your blues arsenal!
Now, let's talk about technique. The blues scale is your ticket to bluesy bliss. Familiarize yourself with the blues scale (C, Eb, F, Gb, G, Bb) and let its soul-stirring notes guide your harmonica journey. Practice bending those notes to add that irresistible touch of bluesy expression. With time and dedication, you'll master the art of bending, creating those spine-tingling sounds that define the blues.
But wait, there's more! The 12-bar blues progression is the backbone of blues music. Wrap your mind around this rhythmic structure (I-IV-V) and embrace the magical journey it takes you on. Experiment with chord progressions, feel the groove, and let your harmonica wail in harmony with the bluesy rhythm.
Now, here's a little secret to add that extra dose of magic to your blues playing: dynamics. The blues thrives on the ebb and flow of emotions. Play with a sense of rhythm, emphasize the right notes, and let your harmonica sing with the nuances of your soul. Experiment with techniques like vibrato, tongue blocking, and tongue slaps to add depth and texture to your bluesy melodies.
To truly embody the spirit of the blues, draw inspiration from blues harmonica legends like Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, and Big Walter Horton. Listen to their legendary recordings, study their phrasing, tone, and expression, and infuse their essence into your playing. Let their virtuosity inspire your own blues journey.
Lastly, my fellow blues maestro, remember that the blues is all about freedom and improvisation. Once you've honed your skills, embrace the joy of jamming with other musicians or playing along with blues backing tracks. Allow your harmonica to be your voice, weaving tales of love, loss, and everything in between with every breath you take.
Are you ready to unleash your bluesy soul on the harmonica? The stage is set, the spotlight is on you. Let your harmonica be your guide, and together, let's paint the world with the vibrant hues of bluesy expression.",All Levels,Musical Instruments,https://www.udemy.com/bones-of-the-blues/,True

785388,Scaling Docker on AWS,"Learn to deploy Docker at scale in about 6 hours
Looking to scale your web applications with Docker? How about gaining heaps of practical knowledge about working with Amazon Web Services (AWS)?
Prepare to get excited about this course!
AWS has over a million customers, some of which are the most popular websites in the world. You can be sure that AWS will be a great fit for your web application regardless of what scale you're running at.
One awesome thing about using AWSis that a ton of companies are hiring people who have experience with it. All of the knowledge you gain from this course can be used to apply for DevOps or cloud computing positions.
The main AWS component that you'll learn about in this course is Amazon ECS, which is the Amazon EC2 Container Service. It's Amazon's take on how to manage a cluster of Docker containers.
The first section of this coursewill concentrate on getting familiar with AWS and then performing a deep dive on Amazon ECS where you'll learn everything there is to know about it. You'll also get familiar with Amazon ECR which is Amazon's private Docker registry.
During this deep dive there will be plenty of guided labs to get your hands dirty.
The second section of this coursewill be all about Dockerizing a multi-service Ruby on Rails application, as well as profiling that application with Docker and other open source tools.
If you're not a developer or have no intentions of using Ruby on Rails that's fine because you can skip the development section. The only thing you'll have to do is build the Docker image, which will be as simple as running a few commands.
The third section of this coursewill be taking the knowledge learned from previous sections and deploying the application to production on AWS in a fault tolerant way.
You'll learn how to calculate costs for a real life project hosted on AWS and load balance the web application so you can scale out to as many hosts as you need.
Along the way you'll learn about many other AWS resources and also learn how to hook up a domain name to a load balancer and secure it with a free SSL certificate.
This entire course is very hands on, with just enough theory to understand the main goal -- which is to get you comfortable scaling your web apps with Docker on AWS.

FACT: HTML5 is the First Language You Need to Know(...and an important part of web and mobile developers' daily work)
We get the question all the time:I want to become a developer, but I don't know where to start.
We don't have to sell you on the idea of becoming a developer. If you're you here, you already know it's one of the most lucrative (and fastest growing) career tracks out there. It's HTML5 that allows you to get your foot in the door. HTML5 developers:
In other other words,HTML5 development skills are critical to all developers. HTML5 is the foundation to almost any development process.
That's why business, design studios, development shops and other organizations need HTML5 developers.
But there's a problem. Most people who learned HTML, learned it in school 12 years ago and have no idea that they're doing.
That's how you separate yourself from the pack.
As aCertified HTML5 Specialist, you are qualified to build, maintain and edit HTML5 documents. You'll be able to help development teams build strong foundations, manage digital content or use HTML5 as a foundation for a strong developer skill set.
In this certification program you will learn:
In summary, certified HTML5 specialists are experts who are able to correctly construct rich digital documents that can appear anywhere on the web, mobile or as part of a larger application. They are able to understand how HTML5 fits into the larger context of web and mobile development and work in serious development environments.",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/learn-html5/,True
987064,Learn by Doing: Vue JS 2.0 the Right Way,"If you are ready to take your frontend web development skills to the next level and learn a new technology which is rapidly growing - then you've come to the right place!
In this course we'll learn VueJS - the version 2.0 to be specific, which quickly became highly valued among professional web developers, because it is really simple (unlike 2.0 versions of some other JS frameworks...) while also very powerful at the same time! The version 2.0 is mature and is already used both by small startups and in the enterprise apps by many corporations in the real world.
We'll focus on the practical side of things by building a small microblogging social network called ""Beeper""! The focus is on medium and large scale applications, so you will learn, through example, how to structure your code and how real applications work.
Also, you'll receive a custom API built specifically for this course, you'll run it on your computer and we will build the client app with VueJS that interacts with the said API.
This is as close to the real world development experience as it gets, folks!

***
With five minutes of your time, I’ll explain why this course is the best investment of time you can make to learn how to code React apps.
*****
When I was first learning web development and software engineering, I used courses, tutorials, stackoverflow threads, and public github projects. It was invigorating - teaching myself the skills that would start a career. But I often found that tutorials only showed mewhatmethods to use, notwhyexamples were working, orwhybugs were popping up. Even when I found a code fix, there was often that missing layer ofhowthe update addressed the problem.
It was a grind, and the learning process could have been more efficient with better resources.
Fast forward five years, and I’m working as a full-stack software engineer at Zendesk in San Francisco. I often think back to those first couple years teaching myself web development.
The resources could have been better, more efficient, giving me not onlywhatto write, butwhythe fix addresses the issue, andhowthe code works under the hood.
So that is what I’ve created in this course. A React learning experience that will give you all three of those important aspects to understanding code:whatmethods to use,whyto use those methods, andhowthose methods work under the hood.
*****
So Why should you take this course?
I’ve applied the best practices of software I’ve learned in my software engineering career, and the feedback from my thousands of reviews in over 15 other coding courses, to craft the best learning experience possible for you in this course. You’ll find a healthy balance of conceptual theory, and practical hands-on experience. You’ll gain skills right from the get-go in the first section. And you’ll build interesting and relevant projects throughout the course.

*****
In this course, you will:
Dive into React code right away.You will gain relevant experience as soon as the first section. Time is precious. And I want to make sure that you’ll never feel like you’re wasting it in this course. So in a matter of minutes, you will be writing React code in the first section, with a fully completed app by the end of it.
Understand how React fits in the big picture of web development.In the second section, you will take an important step back and examine how React fits in the big picture of web development. You’llbuild a React project from scratch- discovering all the layers that are in between the supplies that support the React app, and the browser which displays the React app.
Create relevant and compelling React apps.I’m betting you’ll find the apps both useful and interesting. Useful ones like the portfolio app will help you both learn React, and be valuable as a completed project for your software engineering and web developer profile. Fun ones like “Music Master”, will make coding lively, giving you apps you want to show off to your friends and family.
Dive into React Hooks to learn how to write React apps now and in the future. React hooks, as the new paradigm for React development, are a must in any bootcamp experience on React and frontend web development.
Optionally explore in-depth JavaScript. At the end of the course, you will find a trove of optional videos that will bring your JavaScript knowledge to the next level.

OLD Course description:
No better time than now, and only increasing
With WordPress powering more than 25% of all websites in the world, there's never been a better time to build an income and a business around it.
You're here because you want to master WordPress, right? Good idea. You're in the right place. And, you can do it without learning any programming or coding.
While WordPress is open source, and because of that has thousands of developers building resources for it, it still takes quite a bit of learning to become a master at building and managing websites with it. It's not just learning the WordPress software, there's a small amount of graphic design knowledge needed, hosting and server management, troubleshooting broken sites or problems by hacking into the back end and server setup, and properly staging development environments around new sites or when performing updates and changes on existing sites.
""What a great course! Good explanation and a lot to learn, friendly and very quick support. I'm only at the beginning and I'll leave another review later after I finished this course. I'm sure there is much more to learn!"" --Adriene
Why am I qualified to teach you?
Through this course, I'll teach you everything I've learned and masteredthrough 10 years of building, managing, migrating, and hosting WordPress websites.
""He is concise and well spoken, without dumbing it down at all. As a total newbie to Wordpress, I'm thankful he's offering this! 3 lessons in and it's great so far."" --Jamie Rasmussen
My business lets me work on my own schedule, manage my home workspacewithout a boss or a manager, and gives me an unlimited ceiling for profit and income and time freedom.
Without learning to code or programming anything, I'm able to leverage what's already been done with WordPress to create modern, robust and functional websites for clients of all types.
I'm hoping you'll get to the same awesome place in your work life. Let this course give you the head start you need to increase your income fast.
""[Gregg] has covered more areas than what an average
 course would deliver, this is clear reflection of Greggs' experience in
 the subject. He has gone above and beyond to cover every aspect of 
WordPress for a clear and concise understanding for a beginner.
Gregg is probably one of the best instructors I have come
 across on Udemy and expert in the subject. Well done and Thank you for 
an amazing course.""
--Mohamed Fawmey Mohamed Vinodh
Many of my best and biggest clients have come from ""abandoned"" WordPress websites, where the client's website designer or developer has left the scene. My ability to get in and restore, fix, redesign, and continue to manage WordPress websites brings me lots of instant and recurring income.
You'll learn how to do all this in 20 hours of easy-to-follow video content, fun lessons and challenges.
During this course, you'll learn everything you need to know to start or improve your own WordPress website business.
The WordPress Ecosystem
""Straight forward and neat! Just what I need to step up the freelancing ladder. Highly recommended."" --Mr. Graciano Jose Reyes
It's probably no surprise to you that the WordPress community has thousands of really talented and creative developers, designers and technologists working within it. And you may know that much of their work is available as open-source resources that will enable you to build your own business.
The open-source philosophy doesn't mean that no one makes any money. On the contrary, by sharing much of what we, as a community, create, we all prosper much, much more, because we all share in expanding what's possible with WordPress.
By spending zero-to-little money, you can stand on the shoulders of those who came before you, to create your own business niche, by learning the skills and secrets presented in this course.
""Instructor explains everything very clearly, and in detail. So simple to learn and understand in this course. Looking forward to finishing all of the lessons with much excitement. An A+++ instructor and course."" --Mekus

670034,Advanced Javascript,"In only seven hours you will learn enough JavaScript to transform from a junior javascript developer into a senior javascript guru.
You will dramatically improve your chances of getting past a technical interview, landing that dream job and earning more money.
If you are like me you learnt Javascript by just muddling along, seeing what works and learning a thing or two every day.
However, without a grasp of thedeeper fundamentals,you will hit quite a few headscratchy issues, introducebugs, find ithard to read and understandframework and library code and won’t be considered a senior developer.
This unique course teaches you advanced javascript knowledge througha series of interview questions, with regular quizzes on the way through to cement your knowledge.
What are you going to learn?
Types & Equality: The different types in JS and how to check if two values are really equal?
Scopes: The different scopes a variable can be declared in and how to manipulate those scopes.
Destructuring  & Looping: Did you know that JavaScript has for methods of looping over things?
This: We have a whole section dedicated to thethiskeyword. A deep understanding of thethiskeyword is core to becoming a senior JavaScript developer.
Object Orientation: The history of OO in JavaScript from the Prototype Pattern to the Pseudo-Classical/Constructor Pattern all the way to the class syntax introduced in ES6. You need to know the previous patterns to truly understand the current class pattern.
Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript power is in its asynchronicity, you will learn all about the pros and cons of callbacks, promises and async/await.
Advanced topics inNetworkingsuch as CORS and JSONP.
Advanced topics inEvent Handlingsuch as the different event phases.
Why an interview format?
I find that it's only when I'm facing an upcoming interview that I get into gear and really make sure I have a deep understanding of what I claim to know.
I might know the best practice for how to solve a problem, but do I know why?
Javascript interviews are designed to dig deeper into your knowledge of a subject, see if you are just mimicking what you have read or if you have a proper understanding.

1052118,Dissecting Ruby on Rails 5 - Become a Professional Developer,"Latest course update: March 2021 - Added multiple sections for the Ruby on Rails 6 full course update.
Through the years I've constantly heard the same question from students: ""I can follow a tutorial, but I don't feel confident enough to build apps/features from scratch"". This course is my answer to that question. I'm not satisfied in simply teaching you how to build an application, my goal is to teach you to understand how to build professional web applications, not to simply follow a tutorial. This is the most comprehensive course I've ever put together and combines my 14+ years of development experience.
I took a completely different approach in building this course. This course is unique for a number of reasons:
Curriculum- After completing the initial course outline I sent it out to a group of CTOs and Senior Rails developers from around the world. I asked them to go through the list of features and add the full set of skills they look for when hiring Rails devs. The course outline literally doubled based on their input. So the features that we're going to build throughout this course aren't simply my idea of what it takes to build progressional grade Rails applications, it's the combined knowledge over over a dozen premier developers from a wide variety of industries. One of the hiring managers who reviewed the outline responded to the outline and said,""If you send me developers who build this full set of features, I'll hire them on the spot!"".
Deep Dives- Going through tutorials is great. However, many times courses that simply walk through the build out of a project skip over important concepts. For this reasons I have created aDeep Diveat the end of each section of this course. These guides select the most challenging topics of each section and give a detailed walk through of the concept so that you can completely understand how to work with the key features of the Rails framework.
Full Stack- Many courses promise to teach you how to become a full stack developer, but most of them simply gloss over the concepts that you need in order to build truly professional applications. This course was built to walk you through a real world approach to full stack coding. This includes: backend development with Ruby on Rails, front end coding with HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery, along with advanced ways to use SQL for database management.
Immersive- This is not a light and easy course that you can go through in a weekend. This course was designed specifically for coding bootcamp students that have the goal of becoming professional developers. This means that there is over 35 hours of video lessons and you will build a professional grade Rails application by the time you have completed the course.
So with all that being said, let's talk about everything that we're going to build throughout the guides. We're going to build a feature rich portfolio application that you can actually use for your own portfolio(I'm even using it for my own portfolio). Let's walk through the full feature set of what the application will include:
Building out aprofessional Rails environment(if you're on a PC I even built a free C9 dashboard that you can use for this course).
We'll utilize Pivotal tracker to followSCRUM project managementbest practices throughout the build of this application, just like you'll do in a professional dev shop.
Examine how to work withRails generators, including how to customize the generators so that you can have your very own scaffolds.
Work with data flow in Rails. One of my strongest beliefs is that if you can understand how data flow works in Rails, you can build anything! With that in mind we'll take a step by step approach for understanding how data comes into a Rails app and how you can build features that utilize the process.
Manage a database. You'll learn advanced SQL techniques for working with data in a Rails application, including how to manage data relationships between tables along with what it takes to implement efficient queries.
Best practices. Writing clean code is one of the key requirements of professional Rails developers, throughout the course we'll walk through what professional grade code looks like and the common patterns you'll need to know in order to build well written applications.
JavaScript and jQuery components. One of the hallmarks of a modern Rails application is the proper integration of JavaScript features. Throughout the course we'll walk through advanced JavaScript features such as how to integratedrag and drop functionalityfor users and how tobuild dynamic formsthat change based on user input, all without a page refresh!
Streaming Live Data/Page Updates with ActionCable.The top new feature in Rails 5 was definitely Action Cable, which allows for Rails to utilize web sockets and have live page updates. In this course we'll build a real time commenting feature for our portfolio that will showcase your JavaScript skills to everyone who visits your new site.
API Integration. Because most modern applications need to communicate with the outside world, in this course we'll build an integration with theTwitter APIto pull in real time tweets into our portfolio application.
RubyGem Libraries. In addition to teaching you about how to use RubyGems in a Rails application, I also show you how tocreate your very own RubyGem from scratchand walk through how to use it in your application.
In addition to all of these features, we'll also examine:advanced forms, how to integrateprofessional stylesby leveraging Bootstrap 4, building a connection to AWS for file uploads, and how todeploy our application to the web.
In addition to the lectures, I also include the source code for each guide so that you can always have access to the full codebase for the application.
I look forward to going through this immersive program with you and good luck with the coding!",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/professional-rails-5-development-course/,True

What People Are Saying:
★★★★★ “This tutorial really gave me a good overview of HTML5 and helped me understand the major changes from HTML4. The only knock I would give it is that it does not cover web storage, web workers and some other new features of HTML5. For this course being free though and only taking an hour of your time you can't beat the information you get. I think this course will be most beneficial to those already proficient in HTML4.”–Anthony Martin
★★★★★ “Clear, easy to understand and informative course. Will take more Simon Sez It courses.”-Mike Felker

★★★★★“Ireally like this course because I learned so much in a so little time, please beware that this is not a learn by doing course, it is an course that will explain the use of the ‘commands’ in HTML5 and compare them with HTML4. Keep the good work Simon!” -Cinthia Ramírez Rufino
★★★★★“This was a very basic lesson. However, it taught me a lot of things I wasn't aware of. I am a beginner, but some of the other classes I have taken didn't cover some of the fundamentals / basics like this course. I definitely recommend this course to ALL beginners if you're serious about web development.” -John Acosta",Intermediate Level,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/html5-essentials-for-beginners/,True

771198,Reactive JS:  Are you ready for the next big paradigm shift?,"As we all know, web development moves quickly. With frameworks like Angular 2 and React, we’ve seen a massive move in the industry from the imperative programming paradigm to the functional andreactiveparadigms. To be successful in modern development, it’sparamountto have an understanding of how these paradigms work, and the tools that we can use to express them.
This course is an introduction to the core concepts of the reactive programming paradigm. We will use theRxJS(Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) library as a way to explore this mindset and develop an understanding of how tothink reactively. Reactive Extensions are used by many companies - from Netflix to Microsoft and even Github!
Did you know that Angular 2 uses Reactive Extensions for its asynchronous operations? If Angular 2 is your goal, then learning RxJS is an absolute must!
Even frameworks that don’t use RxJS directly, such as Facebook’s React, are modeled after this paradigm - and integrate with itflawlessly.
If you plan on moving forward with modern development, reactive programming should be your next step. With the knowledge in this course, you will gain confidence in working with modern frameworks and libraries. Even if you’re not interested in writing web applications, the concepts here apply everywhere. Reactive Extensions itself has many ports to other languages that you can easily move between!
The concepts in this course offer a new way to reason about code -and will apply no matter what language, platform, framework, or library you wish to use!

1006894,"React.js: Building Production Ready Apps, Start to Finish","This course is a complete view into building production ready applications using React and Reactive Extensions!
React is a view library created by Facebook that has taken the JavaScript community by storm over the last few years. It's largely responsible for a paradigm shift in web development, emphasizing the creation of reusable, modular components that are easy to understand and manipulate. Used properly, React can eliminate most, if not all, of the error-prone, long-winded, DOM manipulation code you may have had to write in the past!
Reactive Extensions (RXJS) is a library that allows us to write reactive code in JavaScript. As you'll see in this course, RXJS and React go hand in hand to provide a complete, modern, easy to understand architecture for our applications. While we use RXJS in lieu of Redux or Flux, inspiration from both are heavily borrowed; so you will leave this course with a leg up in understanding the core principles of those patterns as well!
This series is a project-based look at using all of the technologies that are becoming commonplace in the web development world. We use Gulp, WebPack, Babel, SASS, and Jasmine to put together a real-world asset pipeline that will support the development and deployment of our application.
This course has four main sections:
Finally, at the end of this course, we willdeployour application to afreeHeroku hosting account!

This course is perfect for someone who has little knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. We are not saying that you need to be guru of javascript but little concepts like Loops and functions should be familiar to you. If you know ES6 that’s great, if not, don’t worry, ES6 is also covered in this course.
React is having very high demand in market. One of the top most searched subject on stack overflow. Most of high performance apps are created using react. If you want to stand apart from react, for sure you need to get familiar with react.
Also, if you are looking to move in react-native app development, that path goes with react js. Once you are familiar with concepts like JSX, props and states; same concepts are applied in react native too. And moving into react-native would be just a piece of cake.

1070976,"Complete E-Commerce Course - Java,Spring,Hibernate and MySQL","
WELCOME TO MY ""COMPLETE E-COMMERCE COURSE - JAVA, SPRING, HIBERNATE AND MYSQL""!

Overview
This is a course about building a E-Commerce website usingmodern Java Full Stacktechnologies. Specifically, it's about building anonline bookstore.
It's about bookstore, but themodules developed in the course is similar for all E-Commerce website. Those modules contains:

- User Signup and Login
- User profile management
- Product Management
- Shopping Cart
- Order checkout and order history
- Automatic email confirmation

As you can see, those modules are the basics for pretty much any E-Commerce website. Check out the preview lesson for aquick tour of the website!
From the architecture perspective, the system is divided into two parts -BookstoreandAdminPortal. Bookstore is the front-end website that customer will be using for submitting orders while AdminPortal is used for administration purpose. Presumably they will be running on two servers. The good side is the two apps are decoupled in some way so that they can be managed separately. The drawback would be that we need to maintain two copies of the code. We can see that throughout the course.

Why should I take this course?
Because you probably won't find another course out there on similar topic with similar length and detail. This course covers a wide range of topics on building an e-commerce website . It is a step-by-step guide with most of the code hand typing.
There are students from my other courses complaining that if I copy and paste the code and then explain it, tough it can save some time, students will lose track and drive. That's why I'm developing stuff in this course from scratch and step-by-step.

What does the technology stack look like ?
As this is a full stack development project, we will develop the code for both front-end and backend. A considerable amount of work will be on developing the front-end code using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Thymeleaf, bootstrap and etc. Thymeleaf is the latest Java template engine, which is supposed to replace previous JSP way (JSP is discontinued but is still being used out there) and it is the official template engine backed by Spring Framework, though it's not the only one you can choose. The backend side will be using latest Spring technologies - Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data and etc. Then, we will have MySQL as database. MySQL is powerful and free to use and serves as a good database candidate in plenty of commercial apps out there.

Will I get the source code?
Source code and database scripts are provided in the very beginning of the course. Besides, throughout each lesson (I would say most lessons), the source code will be provided to the progress of the lesson. Yet, I still suggest you to develop with me and take the source code as a reference.

What will I get by the end of the course?
This course shows an example of building an E-Commerce app from scratch. By the end of the course, you will get exposed to various topics and building modules that you need for a basic E-Commerce web app. With the hands-on practice, you will gain a lot of experience that is beyond just the theory. Nevertheless, you can potentially deploy this web app on Heroku as a showcase (see my other course on deploying Spring Boot app on Heroku). This will definitely be helpful during interview if you can showcase this app.",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/complete-e-commerce-course-javaspringhibernate-and-mysql/,True

""the pace the instructor is going is really adaptive, i absolutely have no problem coding in real-time. all of the instructions are step by step and the instructor actually makes sure that you understand his concept before he moves on. waiting for you next course!"" - Jay DoughlasIn this course I will try to cover every concept of building a website from start to finish. We will be using the most popular CSS framework called Bootstrap 4 (we will get in-depth about Bootstrap). We’ll start withwire-framingour design (I will tell you why this is very important). Then, step by step we will design and code all the sections that the website will be able to offer.

 We will spice up the website with creating amazing animations using tricks and techniques that I will teach you. You will be creating animations on hover and animations on scroll that will make your website look like a piece of cake. That’s not all though, we will also create smooth scrolling on our website so it can offer even better user experience for the end-user.
To summarize – We will be using a free wire-framing tool to create our prototypes. HTML and CSS will be used to code and build our website. Bootstrap will help us create a responsive website that will be accessible on smaller screens and mobile devices. Also, we will even use a little bit of JavaScript and jQuery to do some event driven things like animations on scroll or trigger animations.

1123098,RxJs & Reactive Programming Angular Masterclass - Angular 4,"This Course in a Nutshell
This course is a catalog of commonly used designpatterns (and some anti-patterns) that every Angular developer should know.
The goal of the course is to teach you how to comfortably design and develop applications in Angular in Reactive styleusing just plain RxJs, and nothing more.
This course comes with a running Github repository with the the finished code, as well as starting points for different sections of the course in case that you want to code along, which we recommend as its the best way to learn.
This course answers the common question: how far can we go in Angular whileusing only plain RxJs and nothing more, without introducing any state management library?
It turns out that the simple set of techniques taught in this course are verywell suited for a wide range of applications, especially in-house built enterprise applications
In this course, you will learn exactly how to use RxJs to design and develop both the service and the view layers of your application, and you will understand both the advantages and the pitfalls of the reactive approach
Particularly when it comes to state management, it turns out that we can already go very far by leveraging only plain Angular and RxJs techniques,without using an additional state management librarylike for example NgRx
These simplified state management techniques areadequate and sufficient for a large range of applications,  and we believe that you should consider them first before thinking of adopting a full-blown state management solution
How far can you go with these techniques? That's what you will find out in this course.
Course Overview
We are going to start our course by taking a small Angular application that is written in imperative style, and we are going to talk about some of the problems of that aproach Then, we are going to refactor the application and explain step-by-step how to implement it in reactive style instead.
We willexplain in detail every RxJs operator that we come acrossin this course, the first time that we need each operator.
We are going to start with a fully stateless solution first, but later we are going to improve the user experience by applying somesimple RxJs-only state management techniquesWe are going to use these patterns in order to handle some of the data of the application, as well as the user authentication profile.
The key element needed to implement lightweight state management is RxJs behavior subjects so we will cover those in detail in the course We will also provide step-by-step reactive style solutions forcommon UI functionalitylike loading indicators or error messages.
Table of Contents
This course covers the following topics:
Review of an application written in imperative style
Refactoring into stateless reactive style, understanding the benefits
Smart vs Presentational Components
Stateless Observable Services
The shareReplay Operator
Stateless UI updates (without state management)
Introduction to RxJs Subjects and BehaviorSubject
Decoupled component communication using shared observable services

Optimistic UI updates
Managing User Authentication state with plain RxJs
Local vs Global Services
Master Detail with cached master table in reactive style
The Single Data Observable Pattern: Avoiding nested ng-component tags
Refactoring a reactive application to OnPush change detection
Conclusion and key takeaways
What Will You Learn In this Course?
At the end of the course, you will feel comfortabledesigning and developing Angular applications in reactive style, by leveraging plain RxJs-only techniques You will know how to apply simplified reactive state management techniques to different common use cases, and you will understand the advantages and the limitations of this approach
You will be familiar with a series of commonly needed reactive design patterns, and you will also be familiar with a series of common pitfalls to avoid",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/rxjs-reactive-angular-course/,True

Entrepreneurs like you are a rare breed. You create incredible businesses and come up with ideas that change the world.
Technology has made the 21st century, the century of the entrepreneur. Thanks to the power of the internet, you can reach a global audience in minutes.
The question is...do you have the skills to be able to take advantage of this incredible opportunity?
If you’re starting (or have started) a business in today’s tech driven economy, then you’ve got to understand the code that’s driving your business.
All you have to do is follow along with me in a series of easy-to-follow videos that will teach you everything that’s involved in:
Project #1: Building an eCommerce site: This project will take you through everything from setup to execution…but it won't stop there. You won’t just be watching these videos...you’ll actually build this site yourself.
Project #2: Launch a Landing Page for your project: In this section you’ll learn how to build a landing page from scratch so you can collect customer DATA through a FORM. You’ll then deploy this to a live server, and be ready to collect your customer’s information so that you can test market your idea to them immediately.
When you’re finished these sections, you’ll understand how huge eCommerce sites like Amazon, Zappos, Groupon & Livingsocial were created.
Instead of spending infinity boring you with the intricacies of a multitude of languages, Coding For Entrepreneurs will teach you the exact languages you need to know to launch any type of eCommerce site & build landing pages that convert browsers into buyers.
The best way to learn is by doing - you’ll never learn anything if you sit and watch videos or read a PDF all day. We get you into action and enable you to achieve results immediately.
You’ll become proficient in:
Coding is extremely logical. Take Python for example - it reads just like the English language less a couple of odd characters (if it doesn’t now, it will soon):
- Django is based in Python- It’s fast, simple, effective, secure, and ideal for ""perfectionists with deadlines""- Built-In User Login (authentication) System- Web-based Admin system (built - in)- Template system that allows basic knowledge of HTML/CSS to design the front-end.- Growing Community for Help/Advice/Best Practices .... and freelance clients (or jobs).- Easy to implement & Launch
The truth is that you could learn all of these languages and use them to further enhance your coding.
But why bother?
You’re an entrepreneur, NOT a professional coder. Would you rather learn how to code something quickly and start building your business empire or spend years debugging something that may never launch?
It’s time to take your future into your own hands and learn how to start Coding For Entrepreneurs today!
- Watch the videos and follow me and do exactly as I do- If you get stuck, rewind and rewatch while copying me again- If you’re still stuck, ask questions! I WILL respond to you really quickly!- Months later if you get stuck, come back and watch the videos all over again :)- Do NOT take notes. Implement what is happening as you see it.- When finished, repeat the classes. Start fresh. Delete Everything. Do it again- Repetition is key: it’s like practicing to master a golf swing or a basketball shot- When you get stuck ASK QUESTIONS - I’ll help you- Remember that learning this will put you light years ahead of other entrepreneurs

From a student regarding Windows Users:
""The easiest way to take this course in terms of learning is through a Linux VM. On Windows, download Virtualbox and a Linux .iso (e.g. Ubuntu). Once downloaded, open Virtualbox, follow the steps to create a Ubuntu VM, select the .iso from your hard drive, install Ubuntu and you're good to go with all the commands mentioned in this course. The only extra command I've had so far to install pip is 'sudo apt-get install python-setuptools'."" -- Harry
1) I am not technical at all, are you sure I should take this class?There was a time you didn't know how to read, or write, or speak, or walk, or... I believe you are not technical because you didn't take the time to learn through the hard times OR because you haven't even tried.

Getting help is easier than EVER and often comes for free.
2) Is Django actually that good? It's the default choice for Instagram, Mozilla, Pinterest, Disqus, and many, many more. Django is lightweight, super flexible, easy to learn, easy to implement. I believe it's that good.
3) What makes Python a good language for beginners? Python looks closest to the English language next to many other programming languages and therefore is easier to learn. Python uses spaces "" "" more often than "";"" or ""$"" or ""{"" or ""("" like PHP and Ruby use.
4) I already know PHP (or another language), should I learn Python/Django? There are two schools of thought: 1) Yes because it's awesome and makes it easy to implemented web-based projects or 2) No because you don't really need to know more than 1 language. If there is any feeling of desire to learn more, do it.
5) Why don't I just use Wordpress or another platform? I think this is like asking a chef why he doesn't follow someone else's recipe. The other recipe might be fantastic... but it's still following a recipe. A true chef creates. A cook follows. Using a platform can be great...but to truly innovate, you need to know how to do it yourself.
6) I see that Django version 1.6 and Python 2.7 is what is used... isn't Python 3.4 and Django 1.7 out? Why aren't you using those versions? Yes both are out and both are very solid on their own. There is much debate about Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 as to which to use. Mac and Linux come standard with Python 2.7 so we believe it's still a solid choice and will remain that way until these major operating systems change what they use. Django 1.7 vs 1.6 (or even 1.5) is virtually the same; especially for a beginner. Once you understand Django, you understand Django. Regardless of the version until Django releases a huge overhaul (which won't happen anytime soon).",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/coding-for-entrepreneurs/,True
671552,React and Flux Web Development for Beginners,"React & Flux Course Description
Welcome to React and Flux Web Development for Beginners.
This course is designed for developers who know basic HTML and CSS but who want to take their skills to the next level by building data-driven web apps - the kind of apps that can be used for products or startups and the type of apps that can interact with servers.
The course is also for developers of any level who want to know and master React and Flux.
Why React?
Why should you learn React js instead of Angular or Backbone or Ember or Meteor? One reason is because React is incredibly minimalistic. It focuses on reusable view components.Neverhave to copy and paste code again with React. Then take the Reflux design architecture and mix it with React js and you have a full-stack front-end solution that is very lightweight. Frameworks like Angular do a LOT of things, are very heavyweight, and have steep learning curves. Why use a framework that gives you stuff you don't need in every project?
React was created by Facebook, designed incredibly well, and makes fantastic data-driven websites. React Flux is a powerful combination.

1002676,The Full Stack Web Development,"Eduonix
introduces it’s biggest and best course yet! To cater to the
changing role of developers and technologies around the world, we
have introduced a brand newmaster course to become a Full
Stack Web Developer.
With
the fast paced nature of technology, developers can no longer become
experts in aspects of development, but now must learn the entire
process of development from design to actual deployment. This has
introduced a new role for developers – Full Stack Developers.
What
are Full Stack Developers?
Full
Stack Developers are developers that design complete apps and
websites. These developers work on all facets of development, from
frontend, to backend, to database and even debugging and testing. In
short, the developer must understand the app through and through.
Frontend developers are more sought after because of their expertise
of not in one but multiple technologies. They can handle all aspects
of development, and it can result in a more seamlessly created
product.
However,
resources to become a Full Stack Developer are limited and only offer
sections or just random technologies that you must learn and combine
on your own. So, we introduced this course that compiles all
technologies in perfect sync to help developers transition from a
simple developer to become a Full Stack Developer.
Starting
from frontend development, the learner will slowly progress to become
to other aspects of development including backend, database,
debugging, version control and other essential technologies that are
helpful for a developer.
Our
Full Stack Course breaks down the fundamentals of each technology
that you would require to become a Full Stack Developer. The entire
course is broken down into five separate segments: Frontend, Backend,
Database, Other Essential Technologies and Debugging/Version Control.
Each section includes multiple technologies to help you gain more
experience as a developer.
That’s
not it!In addition to theory
based learning, the course also focuses on practical applications by
covering multiple projects in great detail, helping you learn with
hands-on experience.
Let’s
look at the different technologies and frameworks that you will
learn:
Frontend–  HTML, HMTL5,
	CSS3, Twitter Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery
Backend– Node.js, Meteor.js,
	Angular 2, PHP, Ruby
	on Rails
Database– MySQL, PostgreSQL,
	MongoDB, CouchDB, Apache
	Cassandra
Other
	Essential Technologies–
	Memcached, Redis,
	Apache Lucene, Apache
	Solr
Debugging/Version
	Control–
	GIT, Subversion, Task Runners (Grunt, Gulp), Debuggers
	(Xdebug, Firedebug)
Each
technology will include functional projects that you will create with
the help of the instructor. Here are a few of the projects are
included in this course:
PHP
	Job Board
AJAX
	Github Profile Finder
RESTful
	JSON API
SASS
	Template 
Page Cache/Memcached
PHP
	MYSQL Messaging App
HTML5
	Note App Using LocalStorage
These
are just a few of the 40 different projects that are packed in this
brilliant course. So, what are you waiting for? Let’s master Full

910838,The Complete Web Development Tutorial Using React and Redux,"Faster and Better are two words that are constantly heard in the development world. Apps need to be built quicker, perform better and be scalable. This has resulted in technologies such as React and Redux to be created.
So, what are React and Redux?
React JS is an open-source JavaScript library that works as the V in the Model-View-Controller, allowing the system to render components that has additional components written as custom HTML tags. It allows incorporating HTML tags to make the developer’s coding more flexible. Using a JavaScript syntax extension, known as JSX, the coding is more readable and easier to write.
Redux is slightly different. Although, inspired from Facebook’s Flux technology, it is not at all the same. Instead, Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It allows the developer to write apps regardless of the environment, resulting in more consistently running apps. It works by storing the whole app in an object tree inside a single store. In order for a change to be made, an action is emitted, which does not result in the state of the app to be changed but rather a new object to be returned. The developer writes a reducer, a special function, which determines how an action will modify the state of the entire application. This made the app easier to run and even test.
Do you want to learn how you can create apps that are fast and furious? Well, then here’s your chance. This amazing complete course is the perfect place for you to not only become acquainted with these brilliant technologies, but also master them.
Breakdown React and Redux and learn them from scratch. This course includes everything you need to know about React and Redux. The course answers questions such as what is React and its basic features such as components, state, properties and lifecycle; what is Redux and its basic features such as state, store and reducers; and even how to combine them together to create a brilliant app.
In addition to theory, this React and Redux tutorial also includes building a complete hands-on WeatherCheck Application to get you acquainted with using both technologies in real world applications.

637974,Master ExpressJS to Build Web Apps with NodeJS&JavaScript,"You might have heard about such rapidly-growing-in-popularity technologies as NodeJS or the M.E.A.N. stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS). The brilliance of NodeJS is its fast performance and the ability to leverage JavaScript on the server. That's right! Developers can use one language for the browser and the server code. Even more so, they can use JavaScript for the database layer with MongoDB. Therefore, the full stack JavaScript becomes a new standard for web development.
With NodeJS being a low-level platform, it is not a framework by itself. This leads us to a problem of how we can organize code, parse requests, send back responses, use template engines, implement authentication, validation, and connect to databases among other thingswithout solving those problems by ourselves?
For many years, NodeJS developers' choice of web framework is ExpressJS.
After taking this course, you can start mastering ExpressJS by building RESTful APIs for your single-page applications (powered by AngularJS, ReactJS, BackboneJS or any other front-end framework). With ExpressJS, developers can easily organize their code (middleware pattern), add more functionality (npm modules) and configure the server (configuration over convention).
Moreover, Express is mature and very stable so that it's a default choice for small companies and large enterprises. Even more advanced frameworks, like Sails or Loopback, extend ExpressJS (i.e., they depend on Express). Therefore,learning ExpressJS first is a valuable investment,because you can apply the same skills and existing ExpressJS middleware to more advanced frameworks.
This course comes with series of lectures and practicum. The benefits of ExpressWorks course and practicum (ExpressWorks the automated workshop) include:

What You’ll be Learning
This course will take you through building an online marketplace similar to Etsy. You will learn to develop functionalities common to many websites including:
Along the way, we'll learn to use the latest versions of popular technologies. We’ll be working with Ruby on Rails, as well as front-end tools like Twitter Bootstrap and CSS.

1155262,"Angular 2 Complete E-Commerce App Course - Java,Spring,MySQL","WELCOME TO MY ""Build Angular 2 Complement -E-Commerce App - Java, Spring, MySQL""!

Overview
This is a course about building aE-Commercewebsite usingLatestAngular 2 and Java , Spring Framework Ecosystem, MySQLtechnologies and more. Specifically, it's about building anonline bookstore.
You can consider this course as asistercourseof my other one - ""Complete E-Commerce Course - Java,Spring,Hibernate and MySQL"". They are sisters because the functionalities and layout are pretty similar to each other while the architecture are quite different. The other course usesThymeleafas the template engine (an official template engine adopted by Spring Framework) and is coupled to the backend.
In this course's approach, we make the web appRESTful.This approach is becoming popular in the modern trend. While the front-end can be developed with different frameworks, and we choose Angular 2, the backend is decoupled from front-end providingREST APIsas resources.
There arePros and Consfor both of the architectures and it's better for you to go through them by yourself.
Regarding the bookstore app, themodules developed in the course is similar for all E-Commerce website. Those modules contains:
- User Signup and Login
- User profile management
- Product Management
- Shopping Cart
- Order checkout and order history
- Automatic email confirmation
As you can see, those modules are the basics for pretty much any E-Commerce website. Check out the preview lesson for aquick tour of the website!
Why should I take this course?
Becauseyou probably won't find another course out there on similar topic with similar length and detail.This course covers a wide range of topics on building an e-commerce website . It is astep-by-stepguide with most of the code hand typing.
There are students from my other courses complaining that if I copy and paste the code and then explain it, tough it can save some time, students will lose track and drive. That's why I'm developing stuff in this course from scratch and step-by-step.
What does the technology stack look like ?
As this is afull stack development project, we will develop the code for both front-end and backend. Aconsiderable amount of workwill be on developing the front-end code using latest Angular 2, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, bootstrap and etc. The backend side will be using latest Spring technologies - Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data and etc. Then, we will have MySQL as database. MySQL is powerful and free to use and serves as a good database candidate in plenty of commercial apps out there.
Will I get the source code?
Source code and database scripts are provided in the very beginning of the course.Besides, throughout each lesson (I would say most lessons), the source code will be provided to the progress of the lesson. Yet, I still suggest you to develop with me and take the source code as a reference.
What will I get by the end of the course?
This course shows an example of building an E-Commerce app from scratch. By the end of the course, you will get exposed to various topics and building modules that you need for a basic E-Commerce web app. With the hands-on practice, you will gain a lot of experience that is beyond just the theory.",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/build-angular-2-complete-e-comerce-app-java-spring-mysql/,True

THIS COURSE IS GOOD FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS TO MAINTAIN ANGULAR 1 CODE.
The most comprehensive AngularJS training program is here. We love this amazingly powerful framework for web apps and we promise you will love this course. By the end of it you will understand the concepts behind Angular design and will be able to create you own websites and apps. AngularJS was initially released in 2009 and it has been growing rapidly ever since. If you want to be a web developer you must learn AngularJS and with time it is going to be as essential as HTML. Our Angular course will focus on important features such as decoupling DOM manipulation and to decouple client side from the server side implementation in web apps.
So why use AngularJS?
• AngularJS uses directives to add new mark-ups to HTML and turns static HTML files in to something dynamic. It is an innovative approach to incorporating HTML and developing big web applications.
• AngularJS organizes views, controllers, directives, filters and such other elements in to separate modules. This division becomes convenient for building and managing an application.
• AngularJS has a built-in dependency injection system and is unit-testable.
• AngularJS uses data-binding directives to provide a projection of the model to the application view. It automates synchronization of data between model and view components. This allows developers to avoid writing a considerable amount of boilerplate code.
• AngularJS has a built-in template engine consisting of plain HTML pages (views) as well as controllers written in JavaScript to build rich user interfaces.
• AngularJS uses directives to extend HTML dialect by creating new HTML elements and attributes as well as custom HTML tags that work as new widgets.
The Projects Developed for the Course includes:
Basic Angular Website
Learn to create Angular Websites and concepts such as two way binding, url routing and directives
Web Template Store
Learn creation of store based Apps with the project. Implement payment using paypal

1022582,The Ultimate Vue JS 2 Developers Course,"If you're looking to learn and master Vue.js with an expert instructor, look no further thanVue.js Essentials.
In thisseries of three courses, you'll build three real-world Vue.js apps that take you from the very basics of Vue to the cutting edge.
With over 6000 past students, this course bundle includes 10 hours of high-quality video with English closed captions.
Keep reading to see what's included...
Course 1: Build Your First Vue.js App
This first course is an introduction for those who've never used Vue.js or who need to brush up on the basics.
We'll cover key Vue concepts such as:
Installing Vue
Adding Vue to a web page
Template syntax (interpolations and directives)
Lifecycle hooks
Transitions
And more!
The best way to learn is by doing, so we'll put this theory into practice and build a simple but powerful eCommerce user interface complete with products and a shopping cart calledVue.js Poster Shop.
Course 2: Build A Vue.js Single-Page App with Vue Router
Now that you know the basics of Vue, you're ready to learn Vue's most powerful features!
By the end of this second course, you'll be able to build a high-performing, feature-rich Vue.js app using the single-page application (SPA) architecture.
Topics covered in this course include:
Components
Vue Router
Slots
Single-file components
Custom plugins and directives
Webpack configuration for Vue.js projects
And more!
Together, we'll build a movie session times app calledVue.js Cinemathat, unlike the app from the first course, includes multiple pages managed with Vue Router.
Building this app will introduce you to the power and versatility of components-based app design. You'll also learn how to utilize Webpack for an enhanced Vue development experience.
Course 3: Build A Professional Vue App with Vuex & Server-Side Rendering
Are you ready to become a Vue expert?
Now that you're comfortable building Vue.js SPAs, you're ready for Vue's advanced concepts!
In this course, I'll show you the tools and techniques that front-end experts use to build highly optimized, high performing web UI.
Firstly, we'll cover the Vuex state management pattern, which is a special method for storing data in your app that's essential for bigger and more complex sites.We'll then set up server-side rendering (SSR) from scratch. This is where we compile our app on the Node.js server in order to drastically improve page load time.
The case-study project for this course is our most ambitious yet; a Google Calendar clone called Vue.js Cinema that utilizes Vuex, SSR and a host of other optimizations.",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-essentials/,True

712960,"Angular 4 - Concepts, Code and Collective Wisdom","NOTE: All GitHub repositories and SatckBlitz sample apps used in this course have been updated to use (and tested with) Angular v8.This course focuses on the core concepts of Angular.  Particular attention is given to the following areas:
RxJS Observables- learn about Reactive Programming in general, and then the specifics about the RxJS library that Angular uses with HTTP, forms, and routing.  Observables, operators, and Subjects are all covered.
Change Detection- although this is at the heart of Angular, it is not widely understood. I'll explain all aspects of change detection. (Many of the Angular questions I've answered on StackOverflow are due to a lack of understanding of how change detection works.)
Dependency Injection- I'll explain how this feature automatically manages creating services for you, by simply ""injecting"" the desired services into class constructors.
Data Binding- I'll describe and demonstrate all of the different binding types in Angular, but more importantly, I'll illustrate (with detailed pictures) how the bindings actually work -- i.e., the component and DOM interactions.  I'll also examine the common sources of confusion developers have when binding using JavaScript reference types in Angular apps.
Inter-Component Communication and Data Flow- learn how to manage data flow through your Angular application, and how to insert logic hooks that trigger when data becomes available or when data changes.
Consider taking this course if you are a developer who wants to quickly learn Angular concepts without having to read the online docs, blog posts, GitHub issues, and StackOverflow posts.  I've attempted to digest some of that information for you, and I've attempted tostreamline this courseas much as possible -- no fluff!  (Honestly, you don't need a 28 hour course to learn Angular.)
I'll teach you how to architect an app and how to ""think in Angular."" I'll discuss the real and conceptual trees that Angular builds and uses to achieve very fast change detection and multi-level dependency injection.
While exploring the concepts I'll iteratively develop an Angular app that utilizes all of the core concepts. I'll also show you a number of separate, small Angular apps (using StackBlitz) that demonstrate specific framework functionality.  I'll spend time discussing some of the recurring issues that I've seen come up on StackOverflow with theangulartag, and I'll discuss some StackOverflow posts that reveal new techniques that you can't find in the Angular documentation.
Along the way, while you're learning Angular, you'll also learn some TypeScript and ES6/ES2015 features.
Note: There is a changelog at the end of this course -- it is the last ""lecture"".
Thank you for your interest in this course.  I've donated some of the earnings from this course to helping people around the world (mostly education, farming, and health projects) through Zidisha.
Some student reviews:
""Excellent course, The teacher has a really deep knowledge of Angular, and he teach things that you are very unlikely to find anywhere else. I'm very pleased with this course because I'm learning tons of information and tricks that really set this course apart.""
""Straight and to the point. Love it.""
""If you liked Anthony Alicea's amazing Udemy course on Angular 1, you will love Mark Rajcok's course on Angular 2. Both courses emphasize a deep understanding of the material, not just code mimicry. There are already some good courses on Angular 2 out there; however, no one taught me how to ""think in Angular 2"" better than Mark.""
""This is truly a fantastic course, it is very well thought out and delivered. I have completed many courses and tutorials and there are a lot of good ones out there, but this was the first course that I felt really explained the framework, concepts and best practices. There are many things in this course that I learnt to do in other courses but never really understood why, Mark traverses that gap in a very structured and clear way... His combination of theory and explaining things with diagrams and then following up with clear coding examples really makes a difference in this course...""
""I really like the approach in this course. Getting to understand how things work, not just how to do things.""
""Bravo! A must see for Angular 2 developers. Clear and comprehensive instruction with excellent quiz usage. A+""
""i've purchased 3 other Angular 2 video series and this is the best so far""
""I have taken 5+ Developer oriented courses here on Udemy and consider myself a pretty competent developer. This instructor is the best one I have ever seen. He thoroughly explains concepts and tells us the inner workings of angular and why we do things the 'angular way'. A+++ Highly recommend.""
""very informative and the major topic was change detection which was fantastic.""
""the stated material is very interesting and cannot be found in other courses""
""I like the way this course, is more focused on why and how to help yourself writing better, efficient coding. Really helpful.""
""Mark provides with his broad knowledge teaches not only code, but also the context of the code within ng. For a serious ng developer a must do course.""
""This course was great discovery for me. Before taking it, I was already quite familiar with Angular. But still, course provided me with huge amount of useful informations, and clear, to-the-point explanations of not so much understood Angular concepts. I think any serious Angular developer can get great benefits from taking this course. ... take this course to deepen and fortify the knowledge about the framework. In a single place, course explains things about the framework which are very hard to find elsewhere. Furthermore, many additional resources are provided for further learning, which are not only useful by them selfs, but also introduce attendees to the, already vast, Angular ecosystem.""
""Dev wisdom in a folksy, non-pretentious style. If you are trying to learn Angular, you would likely be best learning from two or three different instructors. This course doesn't purport to be ""the only course you need to learn Angular""... and it isn't. Instead, it's a great compliment to an Angular ""from the ground up"" course.

711592,Using Modern JavaScript Today,"This course’s purpose is to introduceanyJavaScript developer onanyplatform to the powerful world of Node.js, task automation, package management and module loading. Basically: Modern JavaScript.
This is course that I wish I had before years of trial and error, source-code spelunking and documentation reading; so with it I hope to save you guys all the trouble and get going writing modern, maintainable, and organized JavaScript today!
Node.js? I thought you said ANY platform!
While this course is a great introduction to writing server-side applications in node (certainly not wasted time, even if you don’t intend to use a node server), we spend most of our time using node as a development tool.
If you’re writing an application in PHP, ASP. NET, or anything else, no problem! Node won’t need to be installed on the production server for it to do it’s thing. We simply use it to process our assets; there’s no need for it to be deployed into production unless your backend server also uses node.
Especiallyif you’re an ASP. NET developer, Microsoft is incorporating these toolsright intoVisual Studio and ASP. NET 5! Node.js isn’t just for Linux and servers anymore! But on the other hand, that means you have to have a good grasp on these tools to stay ahead in the world of ASP. NET - and that’s why I’m here!
Modern JavaScript
To write modern JavaScript, we need three things: a JavaScripttranspiler, a module loader, and a module bundler.
Atranspileris what takes modern JavaScript and turns it into legacy JavaScript that will run in any browser! Using a transpiler these days is practically the norm. There isnoreason why we should be stuck writing 5 year old JavaScript because some of your customers are stuck with ancient browsers. We will be usingBabelextensively for this purpose.
In addition to the new features of JavaScript,modulesare one of the most important aspects to writing highly maintainable,modular(see what I did there?) code for applications from the small to the enterprise. I’m going to show you guys some tools that makes writing properly organized modular code in JavaScriptsosimple that there’snoreason not to use them, even for small projects!
What else will be covered?
Since a lot of these tasks are going to require a bit of automation, we’re going to be introducing you toGulp(version 4). Gulp is an awesome task runner that allows us to write code that can perform automated tasks, such as transpiling or bundling our JavaScript. Note: Gulp is supported as a first class citizen in Visual Studio 2015! It’s even used in the project templates for ASP. NET 5!
We’re also going to take a look atBower. Bower is a client-side package manager that makes it easy for us to install third party dependencies.
Finally, we’ll also take a look atLESS- the CSS preprocessor. I know that’s not much to do with JavaScript, but it will give us a reason to look into automating the building and bundling process of our styles. Besides, once you use LESS, you’ll never want to use vanilla CSS again!",Intermediate Level,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/using-modern-javascript/,True

Understood MVC in one sentence after so many years! Great job Edwin. A great deal of effort has been put by Edwin to create the content in two parts, first for understanding the basic components (eloquent relationships, views, controller etc) and then actually using it in a project. And he loves teaching. We love learning from him!

Learn What It Takes to Code Dynamic, Professional Websites and Web Apps From The Comfort of Your Own Home
Do you ever browse the internet wondering how your favorite websites were built? Facebook, Twitter, Amazon—they were all created by people who at one point in time didn’t know anything about coding. How did they obtain this knowledge?

82778,All about NodeJS,"About this Course
NodeJS is a platform that allows developers to write server side high performance and networked applications. And that too using good old Javascript. But wait ! Isn't Javascript meant to be used for forms and stuff on web pages ?
Well that was 10 years ago. The world has gone from 'Oops! You've not filled up the form properly !'days to today's modern web apps and social media sites that rely heavily on Javascript. Google Apps, Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and LinkedIn, being handful examples of this movement. And to think that this quantum leap would not have been possible without Javascript is not an overstatement. Today, when you socialize with your friends on Facebook, or use your Gmail inbox, you're running thousands of lines of code written in Javascript, in your browser.
With Node JS, you can take this knowledge back on the server, where usually you would expect to see the likes of PHP, Ruby, ASP dot NET etc. But that's only a small portion of the reason why NodeJS is so cool. The fact that you can write full blown networked applications (think chat servers, collaborative tools, real-time data visualisation apps) with just a few lines of code is more than reason enough to not only look at NodeJS, but deep dive into it !
But I know PHP ? Why should I learn NodeJS ? Well, for starters, learning something new never hurts. But most importantly, learning NodeJS is great because :

The Real Problem
So, NodeJS sounds pretty interesting so far, but what really hit me in the face when I was learning all about Node was the fact that, with any new platform, framework or technology, you need to take baby steps, all the way through, to making real world examples, if you have to get to the grips of it. And that leads us to why you're here.
In this course, we'll go from absolute scratch, all the way up to building and deploying full blown NodeJS app on the Cloud !
Project Oriented Learning
With NodeJS, we will build two full blown apps. We will go all the from concept creation, UI/UX design to coding and deploying our app on the cloud.
A. ChatCAT- One of the fun things that you can do with NodeJS is build realtime apps that allow a high number of concurrent users to interact with each other. Examples of this kind include Chat Servers, Gaming Servers, Collaborative Tools etc. We will build a multi-room chat server that allows users to login via Facebook, Create Chatrooms of their choice and Chat in realtime. We will not only create this app, but also deploy it on Heroku and Digital Ocean !
You will learn all about using Websockets, Structuring your App in an efficient manner, creating and using development & production configurations, Authentication using Facebook, Setting up an App on Facebook, Managing Sessions, Querying & Using a Hosted MongoDB Database, Using Heroku & Digital Ocean's Cloud Services and lots more...
B. PhotoGRID- The second complete app that we will build in this course is a Photo Gallery app which lets users upload images into a gallery with the ability to vote up the images that they like. This NodeJS app lets users upload files, which are then resized to thumbnails on the server and stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket for optimal delivery to the front end interface. The entire app runs on an Amazon EC2 Cloud Server which we will create from scratch and configure for use.
You will learn about managing file uploads using NodeJS & AJAX, Resizing Images on the Server, Accessing & Storing files in an S3 Bucket, Querying & Using a Hosted MongoDB Database, Using Amazon's Elastic IP Service & Cloudfront distribution, ensuring your NodeJS app runs automatically even if the server is restarted and lots more...
In the projects above, we leave no stone unturned in terms of execution. This is a complete hands-on course that is not just limited to NodeJS but to the ecosystem that needs attention when a NodeJS app is built and deployed. My intent is hand hold you all the way from writing your first app to deploying production level apps on the cloud.
And I'm always available to personally help you out, should you get stuck.
BONUS:: Here's the best thing about this course. The curriculum that you see gets you up and running with NodeJS & Cloud Deployment. However, there is so much more that you can do with NodeJS, which is why I will keep adding new lectures and sections to this course on an ongoing basis. There is so much more that you will get with full lifetime access to lectures and all updates !!
So, join in the fun !",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/all-about-nodejs/,True

405818,Javascript for Beginners Learn by Doing Practical Exercises,"One of the best Practical Courses in UDEMY ........
Over 5,000 Students taking this course already.........
Looking for a quick and easy way to learn Javascript?
This course if for absolute beginners, and it is an introduction to the major components of javascript. By learning the bigger things in Javascript, you will be able to know how to put the remaining pieces together and will be able to get into advanced courses more prepared.
I'm not going to start this course with False promises.
At the end of this course, you will NOT become an expert and nor will you in any other course. To become an expert in Javascript or any other programming language you need many hours of practice and experience; more like years of practice and experience.
My PROMISE to you.
My promise to you is that all the lessons you will see here, will get engraved in your brain better than in any other course, why? My approach is the practice approach which is the number one key to learning any programming language or technical course faster and easier.
I created a small practice application for you inside the exercise files.At the end of every section, we will jump into this small application together, and practice everything we covered in the past lectures. This approach will make sure that you can retain the information you learned longer.
My goal is to help you understand the major components and prepare you for advanced courses, in this way you can transition to the language easier.
Once you know the major parts of the Javascript language, everything else will be very easy to learn, and that is exactly what this course will provide you.
With years of programming experience invested in this course, you can rest assured that the information supplied in this course will prepare you to jump into any advanced Javascript course and come out on top.
Commonly Asked Questions.....
Q: Is Javascript easy?
A: Yes and no
It depends on the teacher and the student. Learning Javascript is like learning a regular language, you need the major components and then you can start putting everything together. Students that jump into advanced Javascript courses might get confused and take longer to learn the language if they are not prepared with the major concepts.
This course's approach is to teach you the major components not just by watching but also practicing after every section so that you get an understanding of the overall logic of the Javascript language. I find this approach to be better than jumping into an advanced course that will confuse you and leave clueless not knowing what to next, and this is why I built this crash course.
Q: Can I actually make money with Javascript?
A: Yes and yes.
The market for Javascript is enormous and is in demand right now in any part of the world. Having a programming language like Javascript in your toolset will help you make more money regardless if you are working a regular job or freelancing. Javascript is one of the highest paying programming languages out there, and it will stay like that for a very long time.
This Javascript Course Covers the following and then some...
Introduction to the language
Understanding Javascript variables
Understanding Javascript arrays
Understanding Javascript functions
Understanding Javascript Loops
Understanding Javascript Math
Practicing Javascript variables
Practicing Javascript Arrays
Practicing Javascript Functions

Practicing Javascript Loops

Basic front end web development isn't terribly hard to learn. It can be tricky to remember all the things you learn, but after you get comfortable with the code, what comes next? Many developers spend time optimizing code and trying to make it perform better. A lot of time is spent making things work, simplifying functions, making things faster and eliminating confusion. Most developers miss one of the most important parts of development. Optimizing YOURSELF as a coder.
Many companies wish they knew what would make their developers happier and more productive. Putting in place agile software development methodologies helps a lot, but what about beyond that? Is there anything you can do as an ambitious developer to wipe the floor with the competition? Yes, there is.
There are many developers making 6 figures in web development today. This doesn't happen over night, and we've never heard of a get-rich-quick scheme in web development, but given enough time and best practices, it is definitely possible. It takes skill, talent, ambition, but it also takes speed and efficiency. It takes building upon the shoulders of giants, people who have already done what you're trying to do, and doing it better. Finding a better way is what makes programming fun and challenging. Gladly, making use of these resources and becoming one of the best developers out there is largely free, enjoyable, and is only a matter of time. If you have the passion to get there.

Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications. It’s a structural framework that allows you to use HTML as your template language, and is JavaScript based. It has many high-power features like data binding and dependency injection that eliminates huge chunks of coding for the developer, making the process much more efficient and streamlined.  It’s mostly maintained by Google and a wide network of users.  Angular 2 is the latest version of the framework, first released in September 2014.

In this course, I am going to teach you how to speed up your WordPress website without doing any coding or paying any extra dollar!
I am Rihab, an Engineer with more than 5 years experience in web designing and seo. I have helped hundreds of people to enhance their website speed and now I intend to help you enhance your website speed.
I know how frustrating it is to have a slow website; I have been there myself and I know what you might be feeling right now. Especially, when every article in the internet is telling you that you have to fix your website speed.
First of all, you should know that Website speed affects your user's experience. Clients usually avoid slow websites, and not only do they run away from such websites, they also never come back to visit them again!
Imagine yourself going to eat at a restaurant. You sit on your table waiting for the waiter to come and give you the menu. And you keep on waiting for a long time without him showing up. What will you do then? I bet you will leave the restaurant and go to the closest one!
That is exactly what happens when someone visits a slow website.
Furthermore, Website speed affects your Google ranks, and this is something no one should tolerate! Google aims to give their clients the best experience they can get, that is why it favors fast websites and ranks them highly. So if you are aiming for a higher Google rank you have to take good care of your website speed.
I know you might have tried so many online solutions, read dozens of articles, downloaded many plug-ins hoping to speed up your website… and nothing really worked out, nothing fixed your website speed.
But do not panic. In this course you will find the solution for all your problems, and not only will you be able to fix your website speed instantly but you will also provide your website with the suitable plans to keep it running fast with a minimum of efforts and without having to do any coding!
We will start this course by explaining what is website speed.
Then we'll see together the method of measuring the website speed and how to analyze the results we get.
Next, you will learn how to clean up your wordpress website so that you save space for your valuable data.
Then I will teach you, step by step, how to optimize your existing media as well as your new media before uploading them to your website… And believe me, you will be surprised to see how easy this is and how much your media optimization will affect your website speed.
Afterwards, I will reveal to you the special tricks I use to change slow and boring websites into fast and vivid ones. These tricks will be the key points in the transformation of your website speed. When I first discovered them, I thought that I had put my hands on some kind of magic tricks because the huge amount of improvement you will see and experience in your website speed shall astonish you.
In this course, I will deliver these tricks to you in a simple easy way. I will show you the tricks and I will accompany you into applying them step by step.
Here I will teach you how to optimize every part of your website and how to keep it optimized all the time with a minimum of efforts! To maintain a high website speed!
This course is simple, quick and straight to the point. It is structured to respond to all your needs and to suit everyone. Both Wordpress beginners and experts will benefit from it.
You can start by applying these techniques tonight; I guarantee you that within 2 days you will experience a better website speed, and, thus, you will enhance your Google rank as well.
This course doesn't have a fixed price; it gets more expensive every day, i.e. if you visit this page tomorrow you might find that the price of the course has changed. Therefore, you'd better take profit of the opportunity and subscribe today at a lower price.
Do not wait or hesitate because each passing minute of your website-life counts. Now, at this very moment, you are losing visitors, clients, and money _and you are losing them for good_, because of your website speed. Act and fix your website speed, let it rank highly in Google, let your visitors enjoy your website, and make them your permanent clients so that you can start collecting your profits!

My name is Jordan Hudgens, and I'll be your instructor for the course. I've built many different Ruby on Rails applications throughout the past few years for companies such as Eventbrite and Quip and one of my passions is helping individuals learn how to code.
After completing this course you will be able to build a production Rails project from scratch. But there are a million courses that will help you do that. What makes this course different is that you'll learn how to build a Rails application like a professional developer. I took a completely different approach to creating this course. I don't edit any mistakes and I filmed the entire set of videos in real time so you can watch my exact process when I am tasked with building a real world application. I made this decision so that you can get a transparent view into what it takes to become a pro developer, and also so you can see how I work through challenges, all in real time.
One of the most critical requirements for a professional Rails developer is a strong knowledge  of testing. With that in mind, every feature that we build in the course will be created with the test driven development process. Some of the key features you'll learn how to implement are:
This course is not for the faint of heart. The ideal student for this project is someone who has already taken a basic Rails course and wants to take their skill to the professional level.
Each lesson comes paired with the source code implemented at that stage so that you can follow along and compare your code with the codebase for the application. And beyond that you can also use the source code to extend it and build your own production applications.

617158,Unit Testing AngularJS: Build Bugfree Apps That Always Work!,"With over 2400 students and 250+ positive reviewsthis course is Udemy's most popular course covering Unit Testing for AngularJS!
Read on to learn why testing your Angular code can help you build stronger apps that always work when you need them to.
When I first started using Angular for our projects, I fell in love with just how easy it was to create apps which looked and worked great.
But as the apps we developed became more complex, and the number of people working on the same codebase grew, it became more and more difficult to keep track of all the changes happening in the code and what it’s actually meant to be doing, which lead to a lot of bugs and headaches.
Re-writing or fixing broken code is not only frustratingly boring, it’s also a massive waste of time and money.
So I’d like to help you out, by showing you how learning about testing AngularJS apps will save you from falling into the same situation.
Hi, I’m Matt and in this course I’ll walk you through how toUnit Test AngularJS code so that your app will never again break unexpectedly.
After completing this course you’ll be able to implement unit tests in your own Angular app, so that you can spend less time on fixing bugs and justfocus on the fun parts of development!
Whether you're a developer or a quality insurance engineer, you'll learn skills in this course which apply to any AngularJS environment.
You’ll learn about:

All subjects are taught from ground zero. Therefore, no previous coding experience is needed.
Based on user feedback and tech development, we will keep adding new content to our course. For example, we just added content teaching Vue.js.
For better user experience, all course content is voiced by professional voice-over artists. Therefore, new content may be voiced by a different voice artist.
Why not learn from free YouTube videos, manuals, and online tech blogs?
Web development has been a popular area for years. The internet has accumulated tons of free tutoring videos and materials. Some of them are actually really good!
Even if you are stuck with questions you cannot solve, just post them on StackOverflow, you will have your answers within a few minutes. The answers you get are also really great!
With all the free tutoring materials and teachers, what is the point of creating this paid online course?
It depends on your own situation and what you want.
If you already have lots of coding experience, then learning web development is actually very simple for you. All you need is to familiarize yourself with a new set of coding grammar and functions.
But if you have no coding experience before, then learning to code can be rather challenging. In this case, you will find that learning from a well-designed course can make your life a lot easier. You will make faster progress as well.
If you just want to have a rough idea of how web apps work and create some basic programs, then there is really no need for you to pay for any courses. Free internet information is more than enough to meet your demands.
If you want to be able to turn your design and idea into programs that are alsosafeandefficientenough to beapplied in real life, and most importantly, you want to do this as soon as possible, then learning from a well-designed and considerate course is your best choice.
You will be shown directly where the best route is. With all the detours being avoided, you can therefore save lots of time and effort.
Why us:
Most online students can only devote partly to their studies. They still have other things going on in their life. Their study will often be interrupted.
We believe this is also a situation most of our students are facing.
Therefore, when designing course content, we have arranged lots of review sessions. In our Vue course, we even ask you to take photos of screenshots.
All our projects will be broken into small bits. We only focus on one bit at a time. In the end, we will combine everything together and create complicated APPs.
Every time previous knowledge is needed, we will either remind you to review previous lessons or directly give you a review to fresh your memory.
In this way, we can keep strengthening the foundation while putting more weight on it. Eventually, you will master everything we cover in this course.
In summary, explaining new knowledge to you is NOT our goal. Our goal is to help you master new knowledge as well and fast as possible.",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/web-development-html5-css3-php-oop-and-mysql-database/,True

Reading for parents
Do your kids spend too much time on the computer, phone or tablet? Don't you wish they could do something more productive? Why not get them to learn a life long valuable skill that will lead them into a career that pays 2 times the national average?
Programming is the new math. The average computer programmer makes78k a yearand there will always be a need for programmers. The only problem is that all of the educational courses are not tailored towards the learning styles of children. Most of the documentation is geared towards people over 18.
This course shows kids how to code by adapting the material to their learning styles. There are animated lectures, informative screencasts and tests.
This course is not only fun for kids to watch and listen, it is interactive and fun. More and more people are learning to code so do you want your kids to not have the same opportunities as others? This course offers your kids a competitive advantage.
Employers look for technical skills and applicants that can code are more attractive to hire. Even if the job isn't technical it always helps to have that technical knowledge to communicate with the technical team. Personally, I like to hire people with programming skills. If they are artists, video editors, or social media marketers, I generally prefer to hire people with programming experience.
About me, the instructor
My name is John Bura and I have run the software company Mammoth Interactive. We have had a ton of sales on our software which includes XBOX 360, iPad and iPhone games.

React and Flux are Facebook's response to their scaling problems and these technologies have opened up new avenues for all web programmers worldwide. React has become the buzzword as it provides a cool new framework to solve real world problems and if you are a web developer you must learn this amazing new technology.
This is where ourProjects Using React JS and Fluxcourse comes in. The course has been meticulously designed in a manner to help you understand the technology as well as have a little fun with them. Using 10 different projects, we will get you on board on how to use ReactJS and Flux to make your application unique, just like you!
What are ReactJS and Flux?
Created by Facebook, both technologies were designed to simplify the process of coding and making applications. ReactJS is a powerful JavaScript library that uses an XML-like syntax called JSX to describe component's DOM representations. It allows you to not only easily create interactive User Interface (UI) components, but also reuse them when needed in other projects.
On the other hand, Flux is an application architecture that is used for creating dynamic client-side JavaScript web applications and works alongside ReactJS. Flux is used to maintain a unidirectional data flow, in order to deal with scalability issues that can arise in the MVC and simplify the data flow.
The Projects Using React.JS and Flux tutorial is the perfect way to not only learn these technologies, but also understand how they can be practically applied to create applications. It will also give you a working idea of other technologies that can be used in tandem with these technologies.
In this course, you will build the following 10 projects:
Project 1 – Bootstrap React Components – This is a starter project to help you understand how to use Bootstrap to create basic React components.
Project 2 – Github Profile Viewer – Learn how to use ReactJS to create a UI and fetch data from the Github API.

Laravel is the most popular PHP framework, with more than 20 million downloads along with lots of enterprise and personal projects worldwide. Additionally, it includes fantastic features to implement a RESTful API easily. Laravel is RESTful friendly.

What is a RESTful API?A Web API is like a web service that works entirely with HTTP. A RESTful API must follow the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) practices, allowing to orientate the design to the resources, provide standard responses based on the different HTTP status codes, and the corresponding according to Hypermedia Links in responses (HATEOAS).

Why Laravel?Because Laravel is a framework made by programmers for programmers, expressive, simple, intuitive, and powerful. Laravel provides useful features for web projects including RESTful APIs.
Each new Laravel version includes many changes that make this framework even better, simple, programmer-friendly, and at the same time much more powerful. In fact, the latest versions of Laravel included a lot of new features to help to develop RESTful APIs in the right way.

863812,Spring Core DevOps on AWS,"The Spring Framework is very popular with large companies. In fact, Spring is the most popular Java framework.
Did you know, a core reason for Spring's popularity with companies is it's IoC engine?
A typical company will deploy their Spring Framework application in at least 3 different environments. Having a development, test, and production environment is common.
The problem developers face is each environment is different.
Different server names.
Different databases.
Different user accounts.
Different passwords.
In this course you will learn how to use Spring's IoC container to deploy your application in many different environments. Through Inversion of Control, your Spring application can wire itself for the needs of each environment.
You'll start the course learning advanced configuration options of the Spring Framework.
Next, the course takes a DevOps approach. You'll see how to deploy Spring Framework applications in different environments.
In development, it's common to use a H2 in memory database. Of course, this database is only temporary. Not something you'd want to use for your production deployment.
Do you want to see how to flip a switch and use MySQL? Flip another switch and your app can be using a RDS database managed Amazon. You can do this with no code changes.
The course also looks as best practices used in enterprise software development.
Using a continuous integration server is a best practice. Jenkins is the most popular CI server. You will learn how to install Jenkins on a Linux server. A server you provisioned in the AWS cloud.
Once you have Jenkins running on your AWS server a best practice is to setup Jenkins on a friendly URL.
Jenkins is a Java application running on port 8080. You don't want to be typing some IP colon 8080 into your browser to reach Jenkins.
Want to know how you can use Apache and Route 53 to reach your Jenkins server your own URL? To a domain you own?
Docker is an exciting technology. You will see how to leverage Docker to host your own Artifactory Maven repository. We'll use Artifactory to manage build artifacts produced by Jenkins.
Just for fun, we will also use Docker to setup a MySQL database server. We'll do this by provisioning a Linux server on AWS, installing Docker on it, and then deploy MySQL in a Docker container.
We'll also provision an application server we can use to run our Spring Boot application. You will pull the Spring Boot jar right from Artifactory and tell it to connect to database server.
Amazon AWS also has managed MySQL databases. This is their RDS service. You will see how to provision your own RDS database. We'll then reconfigure our Spring Boot application to connect to the RDS database.
There is a lot of fun and challenging content in this course. You will learn:
How to manage Spring properties.
Why you want to encrypt sensitive properties, such as passwords.
How Spring Profiles are used.
Using YAML to configure Spring.
To provision servers on Amazon AWS.
Logging into your servers via SSH.
How to use the yum package manager to install software on Linux.
How to configure your own Linux service.
How DNS works, and how to use Route 53 to setup your own host names.
How to use webhooks in GitHub to trigger your builds immediately.
Why you don't want to use root accounts for your application.
Configure Jenkins to perform a Maven build.
Use Jenkins to deploy build artifacts to Artifactory.
This is a very hands on course.
To get the most out of this course, you will need an account on AWS. You should be able to use the AWS free tier to complete the course assignments.
To get the most out of this course, you will  need a domain name. You will need to have control of the domain. Without this, you will not be able to configure subdomains in Route 53.
The course does leverage AWS for their cloud services. The skills you learn on the AWS platform will transfer to most corporate environments. AWS is used to mimic the typical company.
There is a lot of exciting content in this course!
DevOps is not an easy area. Many different technologies are involved.
In this course, you will see how easy it is to manage Spring Framework applications in complex corporate environments.",Intermediate Level,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/spring-core-devops-on-aws/,True

This course has been designed specifically to help you transition from a beginner to an expert in TypeScript. All you need is to know is the basics of JavaScript, the rest you will find within this course.

You will also learn use classes and objects within TypeScript such as inheritance, modifiers, adding interfaces to classes, etc.
Last but not least, you will also get hands-on training, by actually designing a project from scratch. You will build a ToDo App in TypeScript with Webpack.

First, I learned an overwhelming amount of information about SEO, with a lot of contradictory information which made me more confused than ever. Then, I had to figure out how to create a more SEO friendly Ruby on Rails website from bits and pieces of information scattered around the internet.
What I wanted was simple: for someone to teach me the basic, most important aspects of search engine optimization (SEO) that I could do something about as a Ruby on Rails web developer... And then give me specific step by step instructions on how to create a more SEO friendly Ruby on Rails website that addressed these most important aspects.
And that's exactly what this course does.
This course assumes that you have some basic, working knowledge of Ruby on Rails, but it also assumes that you have no knowledge of SEO at all. So you'll learn the most important aspects of SEO that you can do something about with your Ruby on Rails skills, and you'll learn step by step how to use your Ruby on Rails skills to create more SEO friendly websites.
Specifically, you'll learn:

For those with more experience designing web applications, there are a number of points addressed that often are overlooked in typical tutorials. This was a great dive into using open source tools and provides a great example of the tools in action. "" - Student Review on Udemy
""Thank you for this course! It fills a knowledge gap that I wasn't even aware I had. As a GIS scientist without formal computer science training, a lot of what you are teaching  here will come in handy."" - Student message on Udemy
""You truly have inspired me to take a step away and focus on learning more webGIS. Thanks!!"" - Student comment on Twitter
""Michael is an incredibly knowledgeable instructor who assumes no prior knowledge. The course content builds up from some very basic coding practices to complex interaction between client and database via a server. Although it was not expected that the exercises were completed I did indeed follow along and now have a fully-functional webapp that I can modify to suit my needs. For an introduction, this course covers an incredibly wide range of concepts covering not only the display and processing of spatial data but also some internet security measures and even a little history thrown in which makes it much easier to understand the possibilities and limitations of Web GIS. I am thoroughly looking forward to starting Michael's Leaflet course."" - Student Review on Udemy
""The course is exactly what I need -- not some copy the script and modify, but rather an understanding of what the process is. At this point, it sounds like a great overview and I am equally impressed with the background and teaching style of the instructor."" - Student Review on Udemy
""Great course does exactly what it says on the tin! Easily digested bite sized lectures that are clear and concise and always put the learning into a geospatial perspective, just what I was looking for."" - Student review on Udemy
This course is oriented towards achieving a conceptual understanding of how web technologies work together to form a web application that can be used to distribute, collect, or analyze geospatial data.The focus will be on understanding concepts.  You will not have to install any software on your computer.  You will not be asked to follow along step-by-step. Instead the goal will be to provide the background information necessary to understand how the internet works, which technologies you really need to understand and when to use them.  We will also explore additional technologies that you may want to explore further as your understanding and needs grow.
We will be using readily available open source software so you will be able to create web maps without spending any money. The concepts you will learn, however, will be equally valid if you have access to commercial GIS software and web servers.
My intention is to provide the information that I wish I had available before I began my journey into the world of geospatial web development.  I spent a lot of time trying to put together the big picture from the detailed information that was available and I wasted a lot of time pursuing technologies that really were not necessary.  My hope is to help you navigate the world of web development more efficiently than I did and that after taking this course you will be better prepared to take more detailed courses from myself or others.",Beginner Level,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-web-programming-for-gis-applications/,True

543346,ReactJS Course: Learn JavaScript Library Used by Facebook&IG,"Stop struggling to code front-end the hard way. React is performing fast DOM manipulations and is easy to learn. No more events attached to the DOM elements. Just declare in React and it will do the necessary manipulations for you (declarative style).
This course is designed for web developers who are familiar with JavaScript and interested in using React as a view layer for their front-end web apps.
Warning: React by Facebook is Taking Over The World
I stumbled upon some guy from Zurich, Switzerland who was arguing that youdon't need MVC (model, view, controller) with Reactjs.
What?
I love controversial topics! How refreshing to hear such a brave opinion after almost a decade of MVC-domitaion.
Anyway, I reallysuck at Angular.
It's just weird to me to use directives in HTML.
It's almost like using HTML to code JavaScript.
I never got used to it. At the same time, I keep hearing good things about React.
That's why I had this idea of learning myself and teaching you Reactjs (with this course).
I used the same approach 4 years ago when I wrote my first book on Nodejs.
It became Amazon #1 Best Seller in the Client-Server category and helped a few thousand engineers.
7 Ways To ROCK With Reactjs
Reactjs is a JavaScript library.
It's used for creating user interfaces (UIs).
It's created and used by giants such as Facebook and Instagram.
Millions of people use apps built on Reactjs.
Think of Reactjs as the View in Model, View, Controller.
The difference between Backbonejs, Angularjs and Reactjs is that Reactjs creates its own virtual DOM (Document Object Model) for pages' components.
You work with them, not the DOM.
This provides tremendous flexibility and awesome performance,
because Reactjs knows the needed changes beforehand and updates the DOM tree accordingly.
This allows to avoid unnecessary DOM operations and makes updates more effective.
Here are some of other advantages of Reactjs:
Only Wise People Can Qualify
Smart people learn on their mistakes while wise learn on mistakes of others. Save time with this course...
I published nine books on JavaScript and Nodejs that have been downloaded or bought by over 10,000 developers.
In addition to that, I haveexperience in online courses.
Three of my courses have over 2,000 students enrolled.
I'm not bragging.
I'm only making a point that I am capable of delivery once the demand is proven by the campaign. :-)
I worked with Backbonejs before. I'm not an expert on Reactjs. I haven't build anything production-ready with it (yet).
This will give me the advantage of a beginner's mind.
That is I won't have the knowledge curse and will be able to explain everything in the layman's terms.

Reflecting on Making this Course
Making this course wasn't easy, but with the right help I did it!  Learning the material isn't too difficult so long as you're not afraid to Google whatever questions or errors you have.  I've found that when you're learning to code it's great to repeat a lesson two or three times, and then you will have a good understanding of the concept and maybe you'll just have to look up some of the syntax.
I'm definitely not proclaiming myself as an engineer, but I did make a cool app!  The hardest part was making the Udemy videos.  I had to repeatedly redo some of my first attempts since I wanted to be clear and to the point, but I eventually got a handle of my notes and it worked out.  Thanks to Steph and everyone else for all the support, and students of this course will enjoy a continuous rollout of new lessons!

HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:
Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files.
Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks.
Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

WCF
It is a framework for building service-oriented applications. Using WCF, you can send data as asynchronous messages from one service endpoint to another. A service endpoint can be part of a continuously available service hosted by IIS, or it can be a service hosted in an application. An endpoint can be a client of a service that requests data from a service endpoint. The messages can be as simple as a single character or word sent as XML, or as complex as a stream of binary data.

Web APIs
A server-side web API is a programmatic interface to a defined request-response message system, typically expressed in JSON or XML, which is exposed via the web—most commonly by means of an HTTP-based web server",Intermediate Level,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/learn-wcf-and-web-apis-from-scratch/,True

Module 2: Here, we'll ""beautify"" our app. We'll be using CSS elements to give our app colors and styles. At the end of this module, we'll have a calculator app that looks like the final result, albeit one that does not perform any calculations yet.
Module 3: This would be the meat of the course. We'll be delving into Javascript in this module, and I'll teach you how to make the app work (perform calculations and display the results) in here.
Final section: Finally, I'll give you some ideas on how to improve the app and make it your own in terms of design and functionalities.

Angular JavaScript, commonly styled as AngularJS, is basically another JavaScript framework like React, Ember, and jQuery (mostly considered as a library). A Google employee, Misko Hevery, created and developed this framework. Compared to other JS frameworks, AngularJS is supported by Google.
For the uninitiated, frameworks like Angular add more functionality to JavaScript and HTML. Their primary purpose is to make it easier for people to create scripts and robust web pages. In addition, they reduce the lines of codes you need to write in order to achieve a certain goal.
To take advantage of Angular JS, you just need to include it in your page and use its numerous modules, expressions, filters, directives, and controller. To learn how to use them, you must have knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Why Should You Take This Course?
First, if you are taking web development as a career, it is a must that you know two or three JavaScript frameworks. Also, take note that the three most common frameworks required by employer nowadays are jQuery, React, and Angular.
Second, Angular is fully backed by Google. You can expect that it will be continually developed and used for a long time. And that guarantees that the demand for people who know Angular will be always be high. Learning it will be a good investment of your time.
Third, it is also useful in creating apps, Single Page Applications or SPAs to be precise. The Web has become a huge platform for creating and using programs. The Internet is not only used for browsing information anymore, but it has become a place where things, primarily computing, can be done, too.
Fourth, MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) stack is getting too popular. For you to become a very competitive developer, you do not need to get stuck only knowing the common stacks like LAMP and WAMP.
Fifth, it is just too easy to learn as long as you have a decent background in HTML and JavaScript. To be frank, learning Angular is just like learning HTML5. You will be mostly adding new “attributes” in your HTML arsenal — of course, Angular is not limited to that.
The Advantages of Angular JS
As mentioned, one of the biggest strengths of Angular JS is the creation of Single Page Applications. Frameworks like Angular make it easier and faster to develop an application or scripts. You do not need to start from scratch. All the common functions and modules are already made for you, and all you need to do is integrate it in your code.
Another strength of Angular is the ease of modular development. Angular provides a better implementation when it comes to modules. If you have code that you will use over and over again, you can just turn it into a module and just call it whenever you want.
Code made in Angular JS is more readable, organized, and structured. If you are going to work with a team, those traits will make the work easier for you and your coworkers.",Beginner Level,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/angular-js-crash-course/,True

Originally created as a means of enhancing the typography of everyday writing, Wordpress is currently the most used self-hosted blogging tool in the world. Wordpress gives users the power to create a fully interactive website without having to focus too much on coding. It gives them the option of selecting themes, color schemes, images and even incorporate different social media aspects to their website.
The most interesting aspect of Wordpress, making it one of the most popular platforms to use, is the Wordpress Plugins. The Plugins are basically extensions that can be added to the blog or website to make it more interactive and responsive. These could be widgets that allow Facebook integration or a built in photo gallery, etc.
Even though WordPress comes with a wide range of already built in plugins, there are many different innovative plugins that are still required to make the website better and easier for the users. If you’ve got any new ideas for plugins, then we’ve got the knowledge you need to bring them to life.
Our course has been designed to give you the basic knowledge you need to start creating your very own plugins. The course has been structured around basic languages like PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery to start making the plugins and will also break down concepts such as Wordpress CMS (Blog System), PHP, OOP/Classes, JSON APIs (Fetch data from different APIs), Project Structuring (how to set up our files and structure them), Taxonomy, Widgets, Custom Post Types, SQL Query and XAMPP/Apache.

In this tutorial you will learn complete CSS from scratch with best examples to understand the concepts better.
CSS Stands for ""Cascading Style Sheet."" Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.
CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document. Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references the CSS file. Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once. For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a Web site. If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the text size only needs to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text.",Beginner Level,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/css-learn-css-from-scratch/,True

688968,PHP with PDO - ULTIMATE Crash Course,"PDO is the best way to access databases in PHP among other web programming languages. PDO is not database specific, so we can use it to connect and control data for a very broad selection of databases. PDO is most  secured and easy way to access any database.
PDO stands for PHP Data Objects and a little Object Oriented Programming understanding is necessary but not required to follow the course.

The awesome thing about PDO is that because it offers data-access abstraction you can use the same functions to create, read, update and delete with any database you choose. PDO doesn't replace SQL or rewrites it but it adds features that are not accessible any other way.

If I am writing an application from scratch on PHP, I mostly use PDO to handle my queries since sometimes I like to switch databases and it would be a hassle to rewrite the API for manipulating data in each database, OUCH.

In this course you will learn how to use PDO to Create, read, update, delete data from any database and lots more.
The best thing about this course is that it goes right to the point and it doesn't waste much time on trivial matters.

What Exactly Is JavaScript?:
JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. It runs on your visitor's computer and doesn't require constant downloads from your website. JavaScript is often used to create polls, validation and quizzes.
JavaScript was originally developed in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, while he was working for Netscape Communications Corporation. Indeed, while competing with Microsoft for user adoption of web technologies and platforms, Netscape considered their client-server offering a distributed OS with a portable version of Sun Microsystems' Java providing an environment in which applets could be run.[citation needed] Because Java was a competitor of C++ and aimed at professional programmers, Netscape also wanted a lightweight interpreted language that would complement Java by appealing to nonprofessional programmers, like Microsoft's Visual Basic.

Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript is everywhere - all your favorite websites and also the ones you don’t like use JavaScript. Makes your web content come to life - JavaScript allows for interaction with content and makes things happen. JavaScript is the dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. Used in all browsers it's the most popular coding language ever. Websites and web apps everywhere are using JavaScript. It runs directly in your browser and you can create html files with a text editor directly on your computer to run in your browser. Select the html file and open it with any browser.
Code is a set of instructions for what you want to happen. Example : When a new person comes to your website, ask their name. Showing a welcome message with their name would be an example of something you might ask JavaScript to do. The instructions for the code would be to provide the user an input area, get the input value of their name, then use that value to return a response. Select a page element and update the contents of the element with the welcome message including the value of the input for the user's name.
The developer console shows you information about the currently loaded Web page, and also includes a console that you can use to execute JavaScript expressions within the current webpage. Open your browser, select the devtools and try it out, we will be using it in the lessons of this course. With most modern browsers you can write and execute javascript directly from your browser. Within the Chrome browser you can open DevTools when you want to work with the DOM or CSS, right-click an element on the page and select Inspect to jump into the Elements panel. Or press Command+Option+C (Mac) or Control+Shift+C (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS). When you want to see logged messages or run JavaScript, press Command+Option+J (Mac) or Control+Shift+J (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to jump straight into the Console panel.
You will need an editor to write your code. You can use Visual Studio code if you don’t already have an editor. First lesson will help you set up and start coding on your computer.
Getting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern Web browser. Create an index html file and open it in a browser Add JavaScript to the html either linking to a script file or JavaScript directly between the script tags in the HTML.
Getting Started with JavaScript
Double quotes and single quotes or backticks can be used to contain string content. A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. Whitespace is ignored in JavaScript code, you can use it for writing code that is more readable and understandable.
Creating variables -
var - Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
let - Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value. Blocks of code are indicated by {}
const - Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant. Cannot be changed.
Variables must be declared before you use them. Comma separate to declare multiple variables. Camelcase is more readable as in the example below.
let a,b,c,d;
let userfirstname = “Laurence”;
let userFirstName = “Laurence”;
Rules for naming variables must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent can be letters of digits. Upper or lower case. No spaces. No limit to the length of the variable name. Variable names are case sensitive. Cannot use reserved words.
JavaScript Data Types and JavaScript Objects
JavaScript uses different data types, JavaScript dynamically assigns the data type that it presumes is desired, you can also change data types of the variable if needed. Arrays are objects that have a preset order of items, using the index of the item to select and identify the item within the array list. Arrays also have built in methods which make them a powerful way to use the data and manipulate and select items contained in the array. Objects also can contain multiple items in the same variable, they are identified by a property name which is used in order to select the item from the object. Each property name can only be used once and is unique within the object. Property names can be set with quotes or as single words within the objects. They get assigned values as a pair with the property name, using the colon to assign the value and comma separate multiple named pair values.
JavaScript Functions
Functions provide a powerful way within code to run blocks of code, also they contain their own scope so variables set within the function can live only within that function. Create functions in code to do repeat code tasks, and handle specific coding objectives. You can pass values into a function then use those values within the function code, and return a result back from the function code. Functions can use arguments within the parameters, although they are not mandatory. Function also can use return although not mandatory to return a response from the function. You can pass values into function to be used within the code.
There are two types of functions, function declaration which uses the keyword function to assign the function code, or a function expression which is similar to assigning a variable a value, but in this case it's the function code.
// Function declaration
function test(num) {
return num;
}
// Function expression
var test = function (num) {
return num;
};
Interactive Web Pages JavaScript
JavaScript can connect to web page elements using the document object. The document object is built by the browser as a tree type structure to represent the entire web page contents of elements and their properties. Using JavaScript to access the DOM or Document Object Model from the browser allows us to within the code select page elements, and even update the page elements. The document object is a massive object that has its own set of methods and properties values that can all be selected and manipulated with JavaScript Code.
Using querySelector or querySelectorAll make a selection of your page elements, assign a variable to the element object in order to be able to easily use that object within your code.
You can update the textContent of the page element using the property value of textContent.
You can add event listeners on your elements with the onclick event object, assigning a function that gets invoked once the event is triggered. Try it out select a page element, add an event listener and then make some updates to the element using the various element property values.
Logic Conditions with JavaScript
Conditions can be used within code to apply logic, and run different actions based on the result of the condition. Depending on the value either True or False the code can run different blocks of code.
The if statement will check a condition, if true it runs the specified code. If false it does not run the code. Else provides an alternative if the condition is not true then else statement allows us to run a block of code on false if none of the previous conditions are true. You can also use the else if statement to check another condition with a separate block of code to be run if the previous condition came back as false.
Using the switch statement allows us to specify several alternatives checking to see if any of the conditions match and allow the corresponding code to be executed.
JavaScript code can use Comparison Operators to check if a statement is true or false. To check multiple conditions you can apply Logical Operators to check logic between conditions. The example below will show how to use the Logical operators and the results that can be expected with the various combinations of true or false.
JavaScript Loops For and While
Loops allow us to execute blocks of code a number of times, they also allow us to iterate through a list of items such as items in an array or other iterable list.
Loops will always require several parameters, such as a starting value, a condition to stop the loop and a way to move through the items to the next item in the loop. We can setup a simple for loop by setting a variable to use with a starting value, then applying a condition to continue the loop if the condition is true, and incrementing the value of the variable so that eventually the condition is no longer true.
Built In methods JavaScript
JavaScript has many built in methods, which are prebuilt functions that allow us to perform a certain predefined action. Math is an object in JavaScript that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers, we can also generate random values with Math.
String methods help you to work with strings and do manipulations of the string values. Strings all have a length property with a returned value of the length of the string. Every character in the string has its own index value which allows us to use JavaScript code to select those characters.
JavaScript List Maker Course Project
Course project is designed to challenge you in applying what you have learned in the previous lessons. Use JavaScript to transform the index.html code, with three divs. Change the page elements to have one as an updatable field, the second into a submit button, and the third into a dynamic list that adds new items when the submit button is pressed. Take the value of the intake field, when the button is clicked and add that value as a new list item to the list in the last element. Clear the first element content and allow users to once again update the element with new content to be again added to the bottom of the list. Create event listeners so that when list items are clicked they update the font color either to red or toggle to black.

Maybe you've already tried going through some tutorials online but you're left more confused than when you started because of all the technical stuff...
...and what's worse, when you'd try and get stuck, you'd spend hours on forums trying to find out what went wrong.
Well, I was in the same situation. My name is James and I'm one of the instructors at TechLemur.
When I was first trying to learn html and css, I spent hours trying to follow along to tutorials but I'd always get stuck and run into problems.
Because there was no one to help me, I'd have to spend more time, on my own, trying to figure out what I was doing wrong.
After a lot of hours, headache and frustration, I finally began building webpages using html and css. Now, years later, I'm doing great.
But here's the thing...
when I was learning html and css for the first time... I wish there was a course or a teacher that could have made it easier for me to learn both html/css and saved me all that wasted time trying to figure it out on my own!
Even now, I still see other people struggling with the same stuff I struggled with...trying to learn html and css, on their own, from the beginning….
So here's what I did.
I took all my knowledge of HTML and CSS and created an easy to follow, step-by-step video course that takes you from knowing nothing about html or css to creating your first webpage from scratch.
This crash course was designed so that you'll learn the absolute fundamentals of html and css to give you a jumpstart and save you hours of frustration and headache.
Here's what you'll learn:
And much, MUCH more….
PLUS the course is project-based which means you'll create a webpage as you're guided step-by-step through the course, with lots of exercises.
This means you'll not only be applying what you learn immediately, you'll also see how html and css are used in the 'real world'.
AND I’ll be personally guiding and coaching you through the course, so if you have any questions you can easily ask me.
AND what's more… you get a 30 day money back guarantee. Which means that if for any reason you don't like the course, I'll give you your money back. 100% guaranteed. No questions asked.

844458,How to Build Chat Bots: From Beginner to Intermediate,"Update: Join over 10,600 students in the Techustler Course Series. Recently, this course has been updated as of 1/2018 with new content including how to design chatbots.
Have you ever wondered how chat bots are made?
Why are chat bots the next big trend?
How can I build chat bots that are cool?
If you ever wanted to understand the space of Bots or build them yourself, then take my course ""How to Build Chat Bots: From Beginner to Intermediate"". I designed it in a practical way so that when you finish the content you can immediately put it into use.
Now, why should you build bots?
Bots are the next big trend according to media journals, silicon valley companies, and web developers. The barrier of entry to build a bot is low enough, but the amount of traction you can get is enormous. This is why startups like Slack have built a billion dollar business around it. Now, we are in the early stages of this trend and in order to stay ahead you must learn a thing or two about bots. More importantly, how to build bots which I teach in this course.
This course contains over 20 lectures and 1.5 hrs of content. It's designed for beginners to play with new platforms in the bot space. You’ll learn the tools needed to build the bots, how the inner workings of bots, how to map a user conversation, and market your bot to your friends.
Course Structure
The course follows a familiar structure where in each video I will teach the concepts followed by the student applying the concepts practically. If your goal is to become a better developer, you should understand node.js, server side development and how to access certain APIs to build better bots. The course does not go deep into API integration of bot responses. This means we won't be building complex models, AI driven bots, or multiple API driven bots. That would be for an expert course.
Environment Setup
This course aims to simulate a live in-person course as much as possible. After you finish each lecture, you should practice and try the solution on your own. You learn the best by practicing and doing.
Projects
At the end of each section, you will be asked to complete a bot which you can then share with your network or on the Udemy network.

50528,The Complete Wordpress Plugin Development Course - 8 Plugins,"100% Answer Rate!Every single question posted to this class is answered within 24 hoursby the instructor.
DISCLAIMER: before you enroll in this course, please read carefully the ""Who is this course for?"" section below. This course has prerequisites and MUST NOT be taken by students that don't have a solid foundation in programming.

Do you want to stop losing customers for not knowing how to create plugins?
Are you also trying desperately to learn how to create your own plugins, but are not succeeding? You've been trying for a few years now, but still haven't found good and up-to-date teaching material. Then got tired of simply looking at how long is the WordPress documentation for plugin creators.
Plugins are part of what makes WordPress be what it is, the most used content management system in the world, present in more than 30% of sites worldwide! Learning how to deal with the WordPress plugin engine will set you free from third-party tools. It will also put a powerful knowledge in your hands that will help you reach new clients, financial independence, or at least a new job or a promotion at work.
All will start with this course!
This course is unlike any course you've ever seen. It's about 100 lessons, organized in three amazing projects, in which I teach you everything I've been learning over the ten years I've been working with WordPress. Absolutely everything! This course won't hide anything. All subjects are covered in great depth, with the teaching style recognized by my more than 20,000 students around the world!
All this using only native WordPress tools. No using plugins to create another plugin!

What exactly will you learn?
Here is a shortlist of the main topics covered by this course. You will learn:
How to use WordPress action hooks and filters to your advantage to control the behavior of plugins and make them more flexible;
How to structure your projects in a cleaner and more flexible way using PHP classes and objects;
How to use the main native WordPress APIs, classes, and functions to create your plugin. For example, the Settings, Options, Widgets, Shortcode, Metabox APIs, and the methods of the very powerful $wpdb class;
How to create custom post types (CPTs), making WordPress the perfect framework for any project you want to create;
How to create your own taxonomies, custom menus, options pages, your own widgets and shortcodes with multiple options, metadata boxes with custom fields, etc;
How to add stylesheets and javascript in both the admin and the frontend and control them via the options pages;
How to install and preview what to do when installing, deactivating, and uninstalling the plugin;
How to control the plugin's template in the frontend, as well as create a WooCommerce-like template override system;
How to create specific theme support for your plugin.

And much more! How about learning how to manage a custom table for your plugin in the WordPress database?
Do you know all the WordPress tables? Do you know what they do and how they are structured? You'll learn all about them here!
In addition, you will learn how to perform all CRUD actions (create, read, update, and delete data) on your own table using the super powerful $wpdb class.
Have you ever thought of leaving the limitations that the WordPress system imposes and building your project based on a separate table? In this course, you will learn how to do it, understand in which cases it is necessary, and what are the advantages and disadvantages.
And it doesn't stop here...
What about using the frontend to let the user submit data to this table?
I think you didn't see that coming! Well, in this course you will understand what you will need to enable a logged-in user to submit information, which will be stored in a table automatically created by your plugin during installation.
You will also learn how to manage your own users by creating an account for them using native WordPress tools.
All this in a very secure way!
We will be constantly on the lookout for possible security threats that could compromise our application. We will use all security items such as nonces (ever heard of them?), string escaping, validations, sanitization, permission functions, error handling, and $wpdb's prepare() method.
How about making your plugin go international?
You will learn how to create plugins that are fully translatable. Customers from all over the world will be able to use them, as they will be fully compatible with Poedit or any WordPress translation plugin.

How is this course organized?
The course is divided into projects. In the beginning, we will have three projects. It doesn't sound like much, but they will give a fantastic idea of what is needed to basically understand how most of the plugins work.
In the first project, we will create a highly dynamic and fully customizable slideshow plugin. We will start with simple subjects such as directory structuring, methods of installing, deactivating, and uninstalling plugins. Then we will move on to intermediate topics such as CPT creation, the Metabox API (used to create custom fields), we will learn how to manipulate the database by adding and updating values in the metadata tables. We will learn how to control menus and submenus throughout the WordPress admin area.
Also within this first project, we will learn to master APIs such as Settings, Options, and the Shortcode API. We will use everything we learn in this section to control the appearance and behavior of the slideshow on the frontend.
The second project is a testimonial plugin. It looks simple, but the number of techniques that you will learn will surprise you.
In this project, we will review some subjects that you will have already seen in the previous section, and learn some new ones. We will learn a lot about the Widgets API and also how to control the HTML templates used in your plugin, including learning how to implement a simple template override system, which also includes learning how to create a specific theme_support for your plugin.
The third project is the most complete and the most complex of the three. Have you ever needed to create custom tables for your plugin? Do you have any idea how some of the best-known plugins, like WooCommerce (just to name one of them), do to create and manage tables outside of the WordPress realms? Do you know why they do this, what are the advantages and disadvantages? No? Great, because you are going to learn that in this course.
In the third project, you will learn about the WordPress $wpdb class, the one responsible for managing all the custom table CRUD operations in your application. You will learn how to create tables, run queries, add, update, and remove data from those tables, using various APIs that you have learned to master during the course, such as the Metabox and Shortcode APIs.
You will learn how to synchronize these actions so that your table works in tandem with the native WordPress tables. In addition, in this section, you will see how to provide a frontend interface where the site user can submit data, without having to access the WordPress admin. We will also see how to use WordPress' own user control system to manage user actions.

Who is this course for?
I recommend this course for programmers, IT students, web developers, web designers, or any freelancer or professional who works with PHP, HTML, and CSS. It is recommended that you have notions of object-oriented PHP because all plugins created in the course are based on classes and objects. It is also important that you know how to use the main MySQL commands.
Other than that, all professionals who want to learn how to create plugins are welcome. It is only necessary that you already have previous contact with WordPress and know how to install it on a local server at least.

How is this coursedifferent?
What my students like most is my excellent response time to their questions. You know, waiting too long can slow down your progress. So I always try to answer within 24 hours. You can be sure that you will never feel alone in this course.
Do you have any doubts? Here's what my student Captain Krik recently wrote about one of my courses:
""Fantastic teacher, everything is explained clearly and simply. The lessons deepen in a professional way the aspects most suitable for a developer,as promised by the author. A big thank you to Marcello who made me learn new and interesting things. I also immediately bought the WordPress course which promises the same things.""
And this one is from my student Nate S:
""I was going to wait until I finish the course to leave a review, but I'm halfway through and I can already sayit's one of the absolute best courses I've taken on Udemy. It does not waste your time dwelling on extraneous concepts like CSS and does not use any unnecessary technology that might require extra setup or become outdated like Webpack. It's straight to the point and extremely clear in every topic discussed in each video.He is also quick to respond and provides links for each topic as well as the full course code for easy troubleshooting.Just fantastic! If he makes another WordPress course, I will be taking it.""

My name is Brad Hussey, and I have been a professional Freelance Web Designer for more than 7 years, so I know what it feels like to worry about being left behind in the web design world!
I always the need to keep up with all of the new technology, web languages, frameworks, tricks, strategies and fads! I've seen it all...

But you can stop worrying...right here and now!
I understand the difference between a passing fad, and what's here to stay.
And do you want to know what's here to stay?
...Sass!
Sass is what's known as a ""pre-processor"" language, and it basically supercharges your CSS so you can create flexible, clean and incredibly powerful stylesheets.
The entire purpose of Sass is to save you time & energy when styling websites and applications.
Why is this a good thing?
I've done some experiments and I've discovered that you can style websites 150% faster using Sass vs. CSS...
For example, let's say a custom web design project takes 50 hours to style in CSS (not unusual!)
In Sass, it would only take you 33 hours to style!
That's 17 hours of saved time per project...
Therefore, if you take on 3 web design projects per month, you'll save 51 hours each month...
That's the equivalent of...

JavaScript is nothing like HTML or CSS though because JavaScript is a REAL programming language, whereas HTML and CSS are not programming languages.
Modern JavaScript included:
Just because this is a beginner-friendly course doesn't mean you shouldn't learn the ins-and-outs of modern JavaScript. You will learn about modern JavaScript concepts such as:
let/const variables
template literals
fat arrow functions
forEach function-based loops
object literals
node selectors and query selectors
and much more
Practice:
There is A LOT of practice (hands on coding) in this course. And you'll be writing code from the very first lesson!
Plus there's a very interactive project at the end of this course.
In this course you will learn these major concepts:
JavaScript syntax
Where to put your JavaScript and how it affects your page
How to debug your JavaScript using developer tools (Inspect tools, console logging, and more)
Storing variables with var, let, and const JavaScript variable types (Variables)
How to tell a computer what to do based on certain circumstances (Conditionals)
The Document Object Model (DOM)
Making custom sentences with string concatenation and template literals
Data types and structures and why they're important (Data structures)
How to make lists and take an action on every item in that list (Iteration)
How to select elements on your web page and change them
Functions, function parameters, and how to use JavaScript rests
Final Project:
Lastly, there's a final project that will make use of almost everything you will have learned in this course.
Requirements:
To start learning JavaScript you should know a little HTML and CSS. These aren'thardrequirements, but I strongly suggest knowing the basics of HTML and CSS before learning JavaScript.
JavaScript is how you make your page interactive, so you'll need to know how to make a basic webpage first.
Basic HTML
Basic CSS
Who is JavaScript 101 for?
If you've never written any JavaScript in your life,this course is for you.
If you just finished learning HTML and CSS,this course is for you.
If you want to learn modern JavaScript in an easy way,this course is for you.
If you want lots of hands on practice writing JavaScript,this course is for you.
––
If you already know JavaScript,this course is NOT for you.
If you know about features such as fat arrow functions and object literals,this course is NOT for you.
If you already know how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript,this course is NOT for you.

997916,Amazon Alexa Development: From Beginner to Intermediate,"Update: Join over 8,200 students in the Techustler Course Series. You don’t want to miss this learning opportunity.
Have you ever wondered how Alexa Apps are made?
Why is Amazon and Google investing in voice technology?
A better question is why haven't you built an Alexa App yet.
If you ever wanted to understand the space of Voice Apps or build them yourself, then take my course ""Amazon Alexa Development: From Beginner to Intermediate"". I designed it in a practical way so that when you finish the content you can immediately put it into use with your Amazon Echo or online counterpart.
Now, why should you build Alexa Skills?
The biggest industries in technology are surrounded by AI, Bots, and Voice technology. Voice technology I believe will be the new 21st user interface that will not only understand basic commands, but will be so smart to understand anything you tell it. This is why Amazon is making a big bet with Alexa which it plans to generate close to $11 billion dollars by 2020. They know something about Amazon Echo which is why now is the best time to learn these skills before the mainstream starts developing applications. We all know the story about apps for the smartphones, this is the same thing.
This course contains over 50 lectures and 1.5 hrs of content. It's designed for beginners to play with new platforms in the voice space. You’ll learn the tools needed to build the Alexa Skills, how Alexa Skills work, and publish a skill to Amazon's Alexa store.
Course Structure
The course follows a familiar structure where in each video I will teach the concepts followed by a challenge or practice question. If your goal is to become a better developer, you should understand node.js, server side development and how to access certain APIs to build better Alexa Skills. The course does not go deep into understanding Node.js but you will understand the architecture and ability to publish apps for Alexa.
Environment Setup
This course aims to simulate a live in-person course as much as possible. After you finish each lecture, you should practice and try the solution on your own. You learn the best by practicing and doing.
Projects
At the end of each section, you will be asked to complete the Alexa skill which you can then share with your network or on the Udemy network.

856526,The Build a SAAS App with Flask Course,"Do you want to create an awesome web application but aren’t sure where to start?
Hi, I’m Nick and for the last year I've been teaching thousands of happy
students how to deploy web applications with Docker.
Now I want to teach you how to develop PRODUCTION READY web applications with
confidence.
Most learning material out there only teaches you how to buildtoy examplesand throw out lines like “you wouldn’t want to do this in production…”,but
then they never tell you the REAL way to do it.
Imagine how awful you’d feel after spending your time and hard earned money but
still had to do a ton of research to complete your project. I’ve been there,
done that and it’s not fun.
Instead,a large portion of the code base in my course is battle hardened from running in production on multiple projects.
I’ll be at your side explaining my thought process along the way while we build
up a multi thousand line application together.
You’re going to walk away with everything you need tofeel confident building
your own web applications.
""Wow, what an amazing resource you've made. The app source is amazingly concise (clearly years of experience distilled). Honestly, it's the handsomest web app code base I've ever seen. - David N.""

""I have been working with Flask for the past 3 years and have been a technical reviewer on the Mastering Flask Packt book, even so, I am learning so much form you! - Pedro B.""

You won’t just become a Flask master by taking my course but you’ll also gain the confidence in developing web applications so thatyou can command the hourly rates
you deserve as a software developer.
This could be done through increasing your rates as a freelancer or negotiating
a higher salary at your job. In my years working as a consultant and talking to
a lot of developers, I discovered that most developers are not confident in their
ability to fulfill work that is requested of them.
Some of them are even afraid to bid on or accept contract work.
This is actually a very common problem and is described as “Impostor Syndrome”.
I’ve suffered from it for a long time and it has cost me tens of thousands of
dollars and now I want to save you the hardship of making the same mistake.
You might be thinking “Nick, how in the world is a course on Flask going to let
me raise my rates?”and that’s a great question but before I answer that, let’s
just play around with a few numbers:

Wouldn’t you want an extra 30k in your pocket every year? You know, the only
real difference between a $30/hour and $60/hour developer is their mindset.
One of them believes they can fulfill the job, while the other struggles to
believe in themselves.
How will Build a SAAS App with Flask help you generate more income?
Simple, you’re going to get a battle hardened web application that you can use
as a bulletproof base for your next project. You won’t have to sit there second
guessing yourself while researching everything on your own.
You’re getting well tested code that’s been running in production.Tons of
edge cases have been ironed out, andfeatures were added due to real life
needs. Not only that, but I’ll be at your side explaining everything to you
while you make your way through the course.
You’re going tosee how the application gets built up from a single file,
all the way to a 4,000+ line projectthat spans across dozens of files and folders.
If that’s not enough, I’ll be available to answer any questions you have in the
course’s forums andall of my courses come with an unbeatable 30 day guaranteethat’s 100% RISK FREE. If you don’t love the course then I insist you get a
100% refund – no questions asked.

986406,Typescript Masterclass & FREE E-Book,"This course covers in-depth the Typescript language and includes several practical projects. It comes with a running Github repo.
This Course in a Nutshell
One of the biggest novelties in the Javascript frontend development space in the last few years is that theuse of Typescript has become almost universal.
To the point that it almost does not make sense anymore to start a new project andnotuse Typescript, given its huge advantages, and almost no downsides.
And this includes projects not only inNode, but also in React, Angular, and any other Javascript-based frontend framework.
Typescript is a strongly typed language that is a superset of Javascript, meaning that Javascript programs are valid Typescript programs (depending on the settings we use for the compiler), but not the other way around.
So in a nutshell, this means that you can seeTypescript as a better and improved version of Javascript.
But even though superficially similar, Typescript due to its powerful type system is actually a completely different language than Javascript.
The static type system of Typescript provides many advantages as it allows us to catch many program errors at development instead of at runtime, and it enables powerful development tooling such as precise auto-completion and different types of refactoring.
But to benefit from the power of the type system, we actuallydon'thave to add type annotations everywhere and end up with code that looks like Java or C#, and sacrifice flexibility, development speed and readability.
The type system can automatically infer the types of most variables automatically, without us having to declare them explicitly, meaning that we can essentially write type-safe Javascript-like code with minimal type annotations.
This powerful type inference is really the killer language feature that makes Typescript the preferred way of starting both a frontend and a backend project today: we get all the benefits of a static type system essentially for free, with no downsides.
Course Overview
This course is divided into multiple sections, that you can take directly depending on your previous level of familiarity with the language. So there aremultiple learning paths availablefor you, depending on your previous experience.
The course will start with a deep dive into all the language features starting with the most basic ones but covering also in detail the most advanced features.
So if you are already familiar with some of the features you can skip ahead, and focus only on the features that you aren't aware of yet.
We will present the language features from the most elementary ones to the most advanced, and we will cover first the features that are most commonly used.
For completeness, we will also cover a lot of features that are rarely used, but we will point that out explicitly, especially if it's a feature that you are very unlikely to ever use while coding at the application level.
Besides the language features, we are going to dedicate a full section to the configuration of the Typescript compiler, and go over every option you have available.
We will make it clear when a compiler feature is rarely needed when compared with features that you will be using all the time.
We will still cover everything for completeness, but we want to give you the option to focus only on the most commonly used compiler options if that is what you prefer.
After this initial section covering all language features, we are going to cover also in detailObject-oriented programming, Generics and Decorators, each in their own section.
These 3 sections are mostly independent of the rest of the course and can be taken separately.
After the language sections, we enter the part of the course that covers practical projects.
Thesepractical projects are as close to what you would develop in the real worldas possible. This means that these are still small projects that you can comfortably build without spending too much time, but they contain all the building blocks and illustrate all the same design elements that you would have to put in place in a real application.
For example, we are going to build a complete example of aREST API in Node using Typescript and TypeORM, a Typescript-friendly ORM for Node. The server will be designed will all the typical elements of a production system in mind.
For example, the API will be fully secure, and it will require the user to be properly authenticated with a JWT. The API will support multiple levels of access, from a read-only user to an admin user that can edit the data.
Next, once the backend is completed, we are going to build also acouple of frontends with Typescript, namely an Angular frontend, each one in its own separate project.
This way, you will have built your complete system (both frontend and backend) using only one single common language: Typescript.
Table of Contents
This course will go over the following topics:
Introduction to Typescript
The Typescript Type System
The most powerful feature of Typescript: type inference
In-depth coverage of all the Typescript language features, from the most simple to the most advanced
In-depth coverage of all the features available in the Typescript compiler
Object-oriented programming
Typescript Generics in depth
Typescript Decorators in depth
Practical Typescript Project  - Secure Node REST API with TypeORM

What Will You Learn In this Course?
In this course, you will learn everything that you need to know tobuild both the backend and the frontend of your application using the same language: Typescript.
You will know all the features of the language in-depth, and you will be aware of the distinction between the features that you will be using almost every day, from the features that you will only sparingly use.
You will also know in detail the multiple features that you have available in the Typescript compiler.
You will know how to build real-world projects with Typescript, including how to develop your backend with Node and Typescript, and also how to build your frontend in Typescript using modern frameworks.

Why learn Flask?
Flask is a microframework for web development, written in Python.
It's lightweight and simple, so you can start using it straight away. As you go through the course and learn more about it, you'll realize it's also really powerful!
Flask provides everything we need for building websites: a good way to organize our apps, helpers for user authentication, a large selection of plugins and extensions to do dozens of other things, and much more!

What you'll learn!
Here's an overview of what you'll learn in this course:
A super-strong HTML 5 and CSS 3 foundation
How to plan your software projects and make them successful
Design websites using design software like Figma
Semantic HTML, and how to code in HTML like a professional
Build backend applications with Flask and Python
Make your HTML websites dynamic with Flask and Jinja2
Become a CSS professional: learn about flex, grid, CSS animations, and much more
Store and retrieve data with MongoDB on the Cloud
Deploy your web applications (using both free and paid solutions)
Implement user authentication on your Python and Flask websites
Much, much more!
But most importantly, learn to code from a professional software developer, and like a professional software developer
I won't cover JavaScript in detail, but that's because you just don't need it! With HTML, CSS, and a backend (written with Flask and Python) you can do almost anything your users want. Later on, you can always learn JavaScript for extra functionality. Trying to learn JavaScript and Python together leads to problems, and everything becomes a bit more difficult than it has to be.
If you already know a little bit about programming (with Python or any other language), you're ready to start this course! Also, I've included a complete Python Refresher section to help you get up to speed with Python if you don't know it well already.

I thought it was too hard, but Ryan makes it look really easy with his step for step increase in difficulty. I built my own website within a week after starting this course, and it looks really great. Keep it up, Ryan!-- Robert de Kok
Those that have tried to learn HTML and CSS before and stopped
This is the first time I was able to go from start to finish with making an entire site. I have done other training before but they don't ever seem to close it off at the end. This class went over everything needed to make a site. I would love to find other courses like this. I also did not feel dumb mid way through the course due to lack of explaining. Everything was well documented and covered. Very good job on this thanks.- Jay Mims
Hustlers who want promotions
Man, I would have to say this is hands down the best course ever! I've done a ton of certifications, training, and real-world experience in other areas of IT. Nothing I've done so far has been as rewarding and I felt like making something and actually have the necessary skills to do so, without looking elsewhere. Thanks for this, I am at a loss for words; I hope this helped articulate how thankful I am. Thank you!-- Cortell Shaw

Reactive programming has become the latest go to technology for many companies, that helps developers design websites and apps that are more robust, resilient, flexible and scalable. All of this with the least amount of coding possible, you no longer have to worry about creating and maintaining way too many nested tables. The best part about Reactive programming is that it works with all the major programming languages that are currently available on the market, through ReactiveX.
ReactiveX is a functional library extension that can be added to your programming to make your app or website reactive. It creates asynchronous and event­ based programs by using observable sequences. It allows developers to make arrays, objects, and also events into an observable stream,which can then be subscribed to and can emit data, errors (if something goes wrong) or even the complete signal if the event completes.
With the few number of resources available online, learning this technology has become a pain. You have to search for many different blogs that do not provide the complete information or very vague articles and manifestos that cover reactive programming, but not ReactiveX. This is why we created the complete Reactive and ReactiveX course, to help you learn everything you need to know about Reactive Programming and ReactiveX API in one place!
From the fundamentals of Reactive Programming and how it can help you customize your app for responsiveness to setting up the environment to even creating a complete project with ReactiveX,this tutorial has it all.
You will learn the Reactive programming paradigms, ReactiveX API and how you can incorporate it with JavaScript. You will also learn how to design observables from all sources possible, including creating them from scratch. We will also cover transforming and filtering functions and even how to combine two observations. Finally, you will design a WeatherFinder Project using everything you’ve learned in the course along with the instructor.

306556,Backbone Tutorial: Learn Backbonejs from Scratch,"There are many libraries and frameworks to help you structure your Javascript code. BackboneJS is one of them.
In this course, I'll take you on a step-by-step journey to learn Backbone from novice to ninja. You'll learn everything you need to know to build structured and maintainable real-world applications with Backbone.
You don't need any prior knowledge of Backbone. Only basic understanding of Javascript and jQuery is enough to take this course.

You'll learn the basic building blocks of Backbone and what they are used for. Then, I'll show you a real-world example of an application built with Backbone and explain how those building blocks work together in action.
Once you get the big picture, we start learning Backbone in a practical, hands-on way from scratch. Lectures are short, concise and up to the point, without wasting your time. I hate courses that waste students' time (with too much rambling) and I've done my best to make sure I won't waste your time in this course!
Each section includes:

Once we cover the fundamentals of Backbone, then we'll cover unit testing and modularising the code. You'll learn the basics of RequireJS and Jasmine.
In the last section, we'll build an application with Backbone in an iterative way. With every iteration we enhance our app in a baby-step fashion. The before and after source code for each lecture is available for you to download to review or to complete on your own.
I've been a web developer since 2000. In the last section, I'll share with you lots of other tips on usability, productivity, clean coding, object-oriented programming, HTML, CSS, a little bit of security and many other things. These supplementary materials help you become a better web developer.
Throughout the course I touch on some popular web sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Four Square and Bitly and explain how you can make something like them with Backbone. So, by the end of this course, you'll have a good and in-depth understanding of Backbone and how to use it in building real-world applications.
""Mosh's course stands out as one of the best online courses I've ever taken, whether for Backbone or any other technology. Mosh's teaching style is unique. He leads the student logically through a progression of understanding in a manner akin to good unit testing.""- David Handel""This is one of the best courses I took o Udemy so far. Mosh is one of the best instructor as it is clear and it's evident that lessons are well prepared and not improvised. Thanks a lot!""-Andrea Salvatore""Very good course, with crystal clear examples.

Now's the perfect time to dive into this exciting new technology!
Unlike in traditional web hosting, where you spin up servers, configure them and then deploy your code, in serverless applications,you don't manage any servers! Instead, you only provide your code and define when it should get executed. Done!
Without managing any servers, you typicallypay way less(since you got no overhead capacity), canreact much better to incoming traffic spikesanddon't have to worry about server security!
For these very reasons, it's no wonder thatserverless computing is on the rise, with more and more companies adopting it! Learn it now to gain an edge and either use it for your own projects or apply forhigh-paid jobs!
What does this course offer then?
This course willintroduce you to serverless computingand thenquickly dive intohow to build serverless apps with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Specifically,you will learn:
how you can build a REST APIwithout worrying about servers, using AWS API Gateway
to set up youron-demand code via AWS Lambda
how to execute that Lambda code whenever incoming requests reach your defined REST endpoints
how you canstore data in a database- naturally without managing any database servers!
We won't stop there though! Instead, you'll then dive even deeper into serverless computing and learn:
how you canadd user authenticationto your existing frontend apps and how you can then also protect your REST API against unauthenticated access with ease!
how you can easily integrate a complete usersign up & sign in flow(including user confirmation) intoANY app(web app, iOS or Android app!) withAWS Cognito
how todeploy your web appin aserverlessmanner
how tospeed up the deliveryof your static web app assets
how tosecureyour serverless app
what elseyou can build with the services covered in this course and whichother servicesmight be interesting to you
where to dive deeper regardingadvanced development workflows
and much more!
Is this course for you?
Now that you know what this course offers, is it the right choice for you? Which skills should you bring?
This course isabsolutely the right choicefor you if you're interested in providing great web applicationswithout worrying about the provisioning of servers.
It'salso the right choiceif you already got experience as a system administrator but areinterested in keeping upwith the latest developments and the many new possibilities serverless computing offers.
You will needsome basic AWS knowledge, or the willingness to dive deeper into AWS alongside taking this course. Additionally, acredit cardis required for signing up to AWS.

On top of all these, you'll learnhow to write quality code,not just how to build apps. There are a lot of developers out there who can build apps but they write poor quality code. Mosh shows youhow to refactor bad code into clean, maintainable and quality code. He also shares his knowledge and 15 years of experience aboutsoftware design and architecture. So this course is more than just technology. It teaches youhow to think like a software engineer.

These are the essential skills that you take with you to nearly every real-world project. Whether you want toget prepared for a job interviewor simply want totake your coding skills to the next level, this course is the means to the destination.



TOOLING
There are two ways to build ASP.NET Core applications. You can use Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio Code, a light-weight cross-platform code editor. In this course, Mosh uses VSCode and the command-line to build an app, but what you learn can be applied in Visual Studio 2017 as well.


WHO THIS COURSE IS FOR
In order to take this course,you should have at least 3 months experience with ASP.NET MVC 5, Entity Framework 6 and Angular 2 (or higher).
If you need to strengthen your understanding of these frameworks, you can watch Mosh's related courses prior to or in parallel with this course:
Angular 2 with TypeScript for Beginners
The Complete ASP.NET MVC 5 Course
Entity Framework 6 in Depth

60 DAY CHALLENGE PROGRAM
Depending on your level of experience, there are different ways to take this course. You can watch it, section by section, just like other courses. You may prefer to code along with the videos or watch a section first and then code.
But if you like toget out of your comfort zone and take your coding skills to the next level,you should take advantage of the 60 day challenge program that comes with this course.
Imagine you and Mosh are team mates and are working on a real-world project. Every week Mosh gives you a challenge or a task to complete. You have one week to complete this task. The following week he publishes a new section and shows you how he completes that task himself. This is a fantastic learning opportunity for you. You can compare your code with his and find areas for improvement.


WHAT THIS COURSE IS NOT
While you use ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework to build an app, the focus of this course is on application building skills and not a deep overview of ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework. Because in any real-world applications, you use only a subset of the features in any frameworks. So, it's impossible to cover everything about ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework in one app. But you'll learn about the key things that you need to know in order to get the job done.
Also, the following topics are outside the scope of this course:
Complex domains and domain-driven design (DDD)
Design patterns
Continuous integration and deployment
Automated testing
Finally, the application you'll build in this course has a very simple user interface since the focus of this course is on coding not building visually engaging user interfaces.


TAKE YOUR CODING SKILLS TO THE NEXT LEVEL
So, do you want to transition from ASP.NET MVC 5 and learn about the latest stuff happening in .NET Core? Do you want to learn how to build a real-world application with ASP.NET Core and Angular? Then take this course and get started.

This course comes with a 30-day money back guarantee. If you're not satisfied, you can contact Udemy for a full refund. No questions asked.

970600,REST APIs with Flask and Python,"Are you tired of boring, outdated, incomplete, or incorrect tutorials?I say no more to copy-pasting code that you don’t understand.
Welcome to the bestselling REST API course on Udemy! I'm Jose. I'm a software engineer, here to help you truly understand and develop your skills in web and REST API development with Python, Flask, and Docker.
Production-ready REST APIs with Flask
This course will guide you in creatingsimple, intermediate, and advancedREST APIs includingauthentication,deployments,databases, andmuch more.
We'll start with a Python refresher that will take you from the very basics to some of the most advanced features of Python—that's all the Python you need to complete the course.
UsingFlaskand popular extensionsFlask-Smorest,Flask-JWT-Extended, andFlask-SQLAlchemywe will dive right into developing complete, solid, production-ready REST APIs.
We will also look into essential technologies likeGitand database migrations withAlembic.

You'll be able to...
Create resource-based, production-ready REST APIs using Python, Flask, and popular Flask extensions;
Handle secure user registration and authentication with Flask.
Using SQLAlchemy and Flask-SQLAlchemy to easily and efficiently store resources to a database; and
Understand the complex intricacies of deployments of Flask REST APIs.
Use Docker to simplify running and deploying your REST APIs.

But what is a REST API anyway?
A REST API is an application that accepts data from clients and returns data back. For example, a REST API could accept text data from the client, such as a username and password, and return whether that is a valid user in the database.
When developing REST APIs, our clients are usually web apps or mobile apps. That's in contrast to when we make websites, where the clients are usually the users themselves.
Together we'll develop a REST API that not only allows clients to authenticate but also to store and retrieve any data you want from a database. Learning this will help you develop any REST API that you need for your own projects!

I pride myself on providingexcellent support and feedbackto every single student. I amalways available to guide you and answer your questions.
I'll see you on the inside. Take your first step towards REST API mastery!",Intermediate Level,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/rest-api-flask-and-python/,True

661774,JSON in Action: Build JSON-Based Applications,"***Quizzes, Hands-On Practices and Unique Projects are Included***
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)is a popularlanguage independent,data interchange format.JSON has significantly improved server-to-browser communications, especially when it comes to AJAX.Most of today's APIs return the response in JSON formatas it is much easier to load, read and process JSON compared to XML, making it very popular.
JavaScript Object Notationis text-based and human-readable.JSON is very easy to use with JavaScript as the syntax of JSON is a subset of JavaScript. Though it is a subset of JavaScript,JSON is language-independent.Most of the popular programming languagesincluding PHP, Ruby, C#, Python etc.support JSON making it the widely used data interchange format.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""JSON in Action: Build JSON-Based Applications"" is a 100% hands-on JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) course.By the end of this course, you will not only understand what JSON is, but also learn how to develop applications making use of real-world APIs that return JSON data. Just learning JSON syntax is not going to help you in anyways. You should be able to use JSON in the development process. Though AJAX and APIs do not come under the scope of this course, herewe discuss how to use AJAX to contact APIs and then to collect the JSON result returned by APIs.
This course is structured as follows:
In the first section, you will understandwhat JSON is, compare JSON and XMLand also learnwhy JSON is not JavaScript Object.
In the second section, you will understand JSON in more detail. You will learnJSON syntax rulesanddifferent data types (number, string, boolean, null, array and object)you can use in JSON data. You will also practise toidentify different data types in real world JSON dataand also towrite JSON data on your own.
In the next section, you will understand how easy it is to use JSON with JavaScript. You will learn how touse JSON.parse and JSON.stringify methodsto convert JSON data to JavaScript objects and JavaScript objects to JSON strings respectively. You will also learn how to get the required information from the available JSON data. You will understand the difference betweendot notation and bracket notation. You will also learn how to useXMLHttpRequest objectto fetch the .json file from a server.
The fourth section explainshow to use AJAX techniques to contact an APIand tocollect the JSON output returned by the API. You will learn how to contact the API using GET or POST methods and also making a synchronous or asynchronous requests. You will also see how you can pass JSON as the input to an API.
In the next section, we discuss how touse JSON with PHP. This lecture explainsjson_encode and json_decodemethods. This section will be updated to teach you how to use JSON with other programming languages as well.
The last section is theLet's Developsection where you are going to apply your JSON knowledge to develop some applications on your own. Now there are two applications in this section.
The first application ""Currency Converter""application contacts a real-world API, collects the JSON data, and performs currency conversion. The second application ""BMI Calculator"" is a more detailed one. As part of this application, you will be developing a simple API using PHP. You will contact that API (which you designed on your own), collect the JSON response and then process it to get the result you want.
So, what are you waiting for?Join this 100% practical JSON courseand start developing API-based applications on your own applying JSON knowledge.",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/json-in-action/,True

This course is for you...
...if you want to improve your market value as a Software Engineer and Security Expert. Imagine what could happen to your professional career if you could add API Security and OAuth skills to your CV!
API Security experts and engineers who understand OAuth are in HIGH DEMAND, as companies expand their digital business. Plenty of opportunities are waiting for anyone who has the right skills.
Do you want to write best-selling iPhone and Android apps?
The most popular mobile apps integrate with popular social APIs of Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, Paypal, and many more. If this is a well-known fact, why do app developers not just do it?
Many app developers are afraid of complicated OAuth integrations. Security is in fact the biggest hurdle for most mobile app developers.
With the knowledge gained in this course, you can use the secret of the best app developers out there and finally integrate your app with social APIs.
Do you want to start out on your own, as an entrepreneur, consultant, or freelancer?
Knowing API Security and OAuth allows you to realize the big vision of your company in the field of mobile apps, cloud apps, and web APIs, such as Google, Paypal, and LinkedIn.
Do you want to build exciting solutions with next-generation technology?
Whether you are a web developer, mobile developer, or API developer, architect, or embedded developer for the Internet of Things, today you need to know OAuth to build state-of-the-art solutions.
What does this course offer?
This course offers an introduction to API Security with OAuth 2.0. In 3 hours you will gain an overview of the capabilities of OAuth. You will learn the core concepts of OAuth. You will get to know all 4 OAuth flows that are used in cloud solutions and mobile apps.
If you have tried to read the official OAuth specification, you may get the impression that OAuth is complex. This course explains OAuth in simple terms. The four OAuth flows are visualized graphically using sequence diagrams. The diagrams are then animated so you get to know the interactions step by step and see the big picture of the various OAuth interactions. This high-level overview is complemented with a rich set of example requests and responses and an explanation of the technical details.
Who should take this course?
Do you believe OAuth is complicated? OAuth may seem complex with flows and redirects going back and forth. This course will give you clarity by introducing the seemingly complicated material by many illustrations. These illustrations clearly show all the involved interaction parties and the messages they exchange.
Do you want to learn the OAuth concepts efficiently? This course uses many animated diagrams and sequence diagrams. A good diagram says more than 1000 words.
Do you want to use OAuth in your mobile app? If you want to access resources that are protected by OAuth, you need to get a token first, before you can access the resource. For this, you need to understand the OAuth flows and the dependencies between the steps of the flows.
Do you want to use OAuth to protect your APIs? OAuth is perfectly suited to protect your APIs. You can learn which OAuth endpoints need to be provided and which checks need to be made within the protected APIs.",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/learn-oauth-2/,True

537282,Hosting Django: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Fundamentals,"Setting up servers for your business or startup can be a tedious and expensive process, particularly when you're just starting out or switching to a new platform.Amazon Web Servicesis incredible but you can still feel like you're becoming an accidental System Administrator trying to set everything up correctly. However, with theright instructions, you can get up and running in a few hours--saving you time, money, and a headache.
This course will walk you through Amazon's Web Services, with a focus on setting up Django and leveraging their Free Tier to keep your project free (for low-bandwidth uses for one year). We'll start with the very basics of launching and configuring Django on EC2, discussing different ways to connect to your system while keeping it secure, we'll progress to fine tuning your system with fast and efficient content delivery, and finally we'll dive into all the ways that you can scale your system on this incredibly elastic platform.
A quick note: Amazon Web Services is used by some of the largest websites on the internet, including Netflix and Yelp, as it's extremely scalable, but, it's also a favorite of many entrepreneurs and VC's who know to take advantage of their Free Tier. It's just a great deal.
What this course is:
An easy-to-understand walkthrough on how to host Django using Amazon Web Services which covers: launching a Django-ready server in minutes or optionally launching a ""plain"" Ubuntu server and configuring Django + dependencies manually (see below for server details), setting up and enhancing security, using FTP & SSH to transfer over project files (a sample project is included) securely, serving static (CSS/JS/Image) files from a Django server and leveraging Cloud Storage (S3 and CloudFront CDN) to make your site faster,setting your project up for production,upgrading your instance for immediate performance increases, adding more instances and load balancing them, separating and vertically scaling your database, automatic scaling with cloud monitoring, deploying automatically with Beanstalk, and more. If you're not happy after taking the course, you will absolutely get your money back.
(Server Configuration Details: Ubuntu Linux 14.04 withApache, Mod_WSGI, MySQL & Django -- but you can easily switch to Nginx/PostgreSQL, if preferred)
What this course is not:
Amazon has a very wide range (hundreds) of features. If you are looking for help on a particular AWS feature, view the curriculum below to make sure that it's covered. We cover many features but cannot claim to cover everything.
You do not need your own Django project as this course provides a sample for you, however the focus is on hosting and configuring Django not creating projects. If creating Django projects from scratch is an interest, consider downloading my (free) course ""Create Your First Django Website - Fast & Free"" as supplementary to this course.
Every single question that is raised in the discussion panel is responded to, but this may not be the best resource to diagnose your server issues. Keep in mind that Amazon offers all kinds of support that is available 24x7.
I've enjoyed working with Django and AWS these last couple years -- it's what I use for my business -- and I would now like to help more people take advantage of this great offer and incredibly scalable stack.
If you want to save yourself some time, money, and, possibly a headache, use this guide to speed up the process of understanding this powerful, scalable platform - remember, Amazon hosts everyone - from the busiest sites on the net, to startups on the Free Tier.

1204590,Angular Advanced MasterClass & FREE E-Book,"Would You Like to Build Your Own Open Source Library?Probably all of us developers have thought at some point in time to build our own library and contribute to the overall open source community. The goal of this course is to give youall the tools necessary for you to be able to do your own open source Angular Library.
We will builda series of small open source librariesof progressively increasing difficulty, and we will learn a large number of Angular advanced features in a very fun and practical way.
What Is The Best Way To Learn Advanced Angular Features?The best way to learn Angular and its most advanced features is to simply take and use it to build something very concrete, like for example an application or a library - and do it in a step-by-step way, as there is no replacement for that experience.
In order to understand a technology,we really need to build something non-trivial with it- blog posts and docs will only get us so far.
This is of course very time-consuming to do without any help because we will have to learn everything by ourselves along the way as we build something, gluing together an endless number of blog posts, documentation and Stackoverflow answers.
So because of this, in order to really dive deep into Angular we will be using it to build a series of small reusable libraries. The goal is to create a practice scenario, and learn the advanced features of Angular in their original use cases, where they make the most sense and so are easier to learn.
What Libraries Will We Build In This Course?We will be building the following libraries, and learn how to publish them on NPM using theAngular Package Format: We will start by doing a Font Awesome customizable Input Box and learn the advantages of designing our components using content projection over a more input/output based design. At this stage we will also introduce the Angular Testing ecosystem.
Then we will progressively increase the difficulty of each library: we will build adynamic tab containerthat allows to receive a template as a component input, effectively allowing to override parts of the component template while keeping a default look and feel for the component.
We will then build areusable dynamic modal componentwith customizable content. This component have its contents configurable via either content projection or an input template, and will introduce the notion of Structural Directives.
We will also learn how directives and components of a given module can interact in a transparent way, independently of the place where they are used in the template, using a shared library service. We will then build a Input mask directive, where we will cover some advanced keyboard handling behavior.
At the end of the course, we are going to take all the components and directives that we built in previous sections, and we are going to build one larger example using them:A Payment Modal Widget!
We will then introduce the Angular Animations module, and use it to animate the modal widget, we will see how to define animations that can be reused across components.
What Will you Learn In this Course?We will learn how to create anAOT compatible library in the Angular Package Format, how to define a library module, how to isolate the styles of a component but still make them customizable, how to design components and directives to make them easier to maintain - making them customizable while at the same time giving the components great default behavior.
We will cover all of the more advanced features of Angular, including Component API Design, Component Styling best practices, Templates and Template Outlets, ng-content, ng-container, style isolation and customization, AOT, global events, debugging with the CLI, @ViewChildren, @ContentChildren, Light DOM vs Shadow DOM, @HostBinding, @HostListener, dynamic components, directives, handling keyboard events, testing, animations and more (this is a non-extensive list).
But more than presenting the features in isolation, we will use them in real use cases which will make the features much easier to learn.
What Will You Be Able to do at the End Of This Course?By the end of this course you will know many of the most advanced features of Angular, but most of all you will know when to use them and why. You will know how to build open source Angular libraries, and know how to make them available to the open source community on NPM.
With this advanced course, you will have a rock-solid foundation on Angular: you will very likely be able to tackle the more advanced Angular development tasks that you will come across in your day to day job or personal projects.

Angular 1 and NodeJS, together with ExpressJS (a NodeJS Framework) and MongoDB formed the very popular MEAN stack. Now is the time to dive into MEAN 2.0 and replace Angular 1 with Angular 2+.
Benefit from the many improvements and advantages Angular offers you: Speed, ease of development, highly reactive, awesome support for asynchronous operations, great scalability and more!And combine these advantages with the power of a NodeJS + Express + MongoDB backend!
Learn or refresh the Angular Basics!
This course is no Angular course, but it includes detailed explanations of the core concepts used as well as about Angular in general. However, keep in mind that, as this course is no Angular course, having additional resources like my ""Angular - The Complete Guide"" course is recommended.
I'm Maximilian Schwarzmüller, an experienced web developer as well as author of many 5-star rated Udemy courses and host of the ""Academind"" coding channel on YouTube. I will take you on a hands-on journey to get you to build your own Angular + NodeJS Applications in no time!
This course follows a hands-on approach, which means that the whole course is structured around one big application and the different concepts will be explained detailedly as they are introduced in this application.
Specifically, you will learn how to:
Set up a NodeJS + Express + MongoDB + Angular Application with the help of the Angular CLI
Use NodeJS and Express efficiently
Build reusable Components in Angular and create a reactive User Experience with the Tools provided by Angular
Connect your NodeJS (or any other language!) backend with your Angular App through Angular’s HttpClient service
Provide appropriate endpoints on your Backend, for your Frontend to consume
Add advanced features like file upload and pagination
Make your Application more secure by implementing Users, Authentication as well as Authorization
Handle Errors gracefully
And much more!
This hands-on concept allows you to not get stuck in the theory, but instantly see real implementation examples!

Max has gone through great lengths to create great content and this course has been great. His teaching style covers everything from basic to advanced topics, and his explanations have been thorough on each topic
Max demonstrates very good knowledge of the subject matter and great enthusiasm in delivering the lectures.
Max does a wonderful job making the core concepts of Angular approachable and accessible.
Don’t stop at the basics!
Do you know those courses which show you a ""Hello World“ example and then call it an end? That won’t happen to you in this course. While beginning with a very basic app and basic features, you will quickly be able to incorporate many different Routes, Observables, Events, Authentication and Authorization, Error Handling and much more into your applications.The best thing is: You’ll learn all that by putting it into practice immediately! No wall of powerpoint slides, no unrealistic mini-examples – this is the real deal!
Who should take this course?
Basic NodeJS/Express and Angular Experience is strongly recommended
You should be familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics, too
MongoDB (+ Mongoose) knowledge is a plus as MongoDB will be used in this course but won’t be subject of in-depth explanations
NO expert or advanced knowledge on any of these topics is required or assumed
By the end of this course, you will be able to create your own, awesome NodeJS + Angular applications!

Mosh has a fantastic teaching style, and just delivered the best online course I've seen in a long time. Mosh's approach to teaching and guiding makes no assumptions on existing Angular 1.x knowledge, but helps those who have to clarify new concepts. Mosh guides you through critical concepts slowly without skipping over details, and the course is extremely worth investing a few hours in, your understanding of Angular 2 will reach new levels. He fills all the gaps, presents impeccably well and the preparation was top notch, seriously can't recommend the course enough.

Having never used Angular before, I'm really impressed at how easy it was to understand the concepts and even managed most of the examples without having to refer back to the lectures and that is in no small part due to Mosh's understanding of Angular and how well he explains everything. If you can't already tell, I'm really impressed Mosh"" -Chris Graham

772618,Learn Object Oriented PHP By Building a Complete Website,"One of the most powerful server-scripting languages requires an equally powerful course to help break down the tricky concepts of Object Oriented PHP in a step by step manner to help you master OOP PHP.
Don’t just be good at PHP, instead be a ninja by learning how objects and classes combine to form simple, brilliant software. Leave behind old complicated courses and opt for the course that gets your hand dirty by not only teaching you the theoretical aspects of OOP PHP, but also gets you ready for the physical aspects as well.
Here’s how object oriented programming blends with PHP to create something simple and beautiful.
The idea behind object oriented programming or OOP is that it revolves around objects instead of actions. So, instead of manipulating the logic behind the object to change something, you instead manipulate the object itself. Let’s make it simpler – in OOP PHP, similar items can be clubbed as one object. This means codes that are similar are placed in one object. So, in case you wanted to change the items or modify them in any manner – you can simply modify or call the object (this will change or call everything that is under this object). You can also add subclasses, which share the characteristics of the object. This helps when you constantly require calling certain classes for modification.
This course was designed to simplify the process of understanding OOP PHP in the easiest and most accurate manner. The OOP PHP tutorial breaks down the basics of PHP coding, how it works with OOP and even how to combine both to effectively create a website.
The course starts by covering simple concepts such as classes, objects, methods, properties, MVC, MySQL, Data Abstraction, Data Binding, etc. Following the fundamentals, you’ll then progress on to more advanced topics before you can use everything you’ve learned to create a functional website with OOP PHP.",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/learn-object-oriented-php-by-building-a-complete-website/,False

1) A restaurant review site for people to browse and rate local eateries:
Admin users can add new restaurants while signed in users can leave star ratings with a review. Anyone can search through the listings index for specific restaurants.
2) A two-sided marketplace for buyers and sellers:
Sellers will be able to upload listings with images, manage their inventory through a dashboard, and charge credit cards with the Stripe API. You'll learn how to take a small percentage cut of each transaction and transfer payments to your sellers.
3) A web scraper to collect data:
Access a webpage's HTML and identify proper selectors for parsing through data. Write a script in the Ruby programming language to scrape Wikipedia and Airbnb and export the information into a database.
4) Apartment Rental Site like Craigslist:
Gather data through an API and use that data to build a custom Ruby on Rails web app. You'll write a script in the Ruby programming language to collect and process the data you receive, then save the information to a database, and build a front-end interface for users to interact with it. By the end of the course, you'll have learned to automate the data collection process and have an app that's live on Heroku.
5) Bonus Feature videos:
Learn how to code your site in multiple lanugages, add social media features, and more with a series of bonus features to feature customize your app.
Web development topics covered:
Web scraping topics covered:
By the end of this course, your web applications will be ready for real users and you can start collecting payments through Stripe immediately. You'll have the skills, experience, and portfolio to get a job as a web developer or build out any idea of your own.

777654,Learn what's new in PHP 7,"PHP7 is the newest edition of the language to hit the server side in 2016. This well established and much loved language is providing significant performance improvements, providing new features and improving security. PHP has always been the goto language when it comes to server side database interactivity and data integrity with simplicity and ease of use.
The first and most prominent speed increase is the PHP7 engines speed which is nearly double the performance of the previous PHP 5.6 engine. This alone should be coveted by developers who don't even need to optimise their code but just to run it in the new engine and see massive performance increases. Wordpress, Joomla and other popular CMS's have been run out of the box with no code changes and huge performance increases have been seen with no optimisation needed at all.
But what about the other features and your script's, Will they work? Well to find out I'll be showing you additional features which may not be that dramatic after all. New features are always fun to learn but some new features will just be a simple parameter being passed into an already existing function. For example the unserialise function will now accept another optional parameter to only unserialise an object that came from a particular class; making it a little more secure. Also as we're on the topic of security and parameters the existing password hash function will no longer accept a salt but rather it will automatically generate a secure salt for you.
The new PHP version is a nice addition to the PHP family with refined features all round. PHP will still be around despite what developers say. It's still currently the best and most secure language for database interaction with PDO, scalar data validation, prepared statements, secure password hashing and salting. It really is still the king pin! Every language has it's place and PHP is firmly settled in on the server side and despite being a Javascript developer it's still is a very established language.",Intermediate Level,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/php7-new-features/,False
267286,"Basic Concepts of Web Development, HTTP and Java Servlets","This course presents the basic concepts of web application development, the HTTP protocol and introduces Java Servlets, in less than an hour. This is not a hands-on course, neither is this a full course on web development or Servlet and JSP.
So, why this course, and how you will benefit from it?
If you are interested to know about or learn web development, then this course will work as a first step for you. It will introduce you to the basic concepts of web development that we generally overlook while starting to learn web development. After enjoying the whiteboard narrations here, you will feel at home while taking your favourite hands-on course on web development.
If you already are a web developer, but yet to feel confident about it, you might find this course quite useful in strengthening your concepts. When learning web development, most of us overlook the concepts and move quickly to hands-on and to projects. And then we keep coding with a lower confidence until we learn the concepts by experience. So, give less than an hour here, and then see how coding web applications become more interesting.
If you are a non-technical or semi-technical project manager, dealing with web based projects, this course could be very useful in introducing you to the subject you deal with, and you would feel more at home with your programmers.
Let me tell you that this course is not only for Java guys, but actually the first half of it, in which we discuss the web application basics and the HTTP protocol is equally beneficial to guys from other technologies, for example PHP as well.",Beginner Level,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/web-application-and-java-servlet-concepts/,True

If you are new to AngularJS, or if you've been working to learn it but sometimes feel like you still don't quite 'get it', this is the AngularJS course for you!To learn AngularJS you have to understand it.
I've built the course that I would have wanted to take when I was learning AngularJS. A course that explains the concepts and how they're implemented in the best order for you to learn and deeply understand them.
In this course you will:
AngularJS doesn't have to be hard to learn. The biggest mistake most coding tutorials make is expecting someone to learn simply by imitating others' code. Real world situations are never exactly like the tutorial.
I believe the best way to learn is to understand how a tool works and what it does for you, look at examples, and then try it yourself. That's how this course is built, with the goal to help you bothlearnandunderstandAngularJS.

*** Completely re-built from scratch in July 2021 (35+ hours video) ***
""Having gone through other related courses on other platforms, I can say this course is the most practical and readily applicable course on web design and development I have taken."" — Bernie Pacis

Open a new browser tab, type inwww.omnifood.dev, and take a look around. I will wait here...
...
Amazing, right? What if you knew exactly how to design and build a website like that, completely from scratch? How amazing would that be?
Well, I'm here to teach youHTML, CSS, and web design, all by building the stunning website that you just saw, step-by-step.
So, after finishing this course, you will know exactly how to build a beautiful, professional, and ready-to-launch website just like Omnifood, by following a 7-step process. And it will even look great on any computer, tablet, and smartphone.
But what if you want to build a completely different website? Well, no problem! I designed the course curriculum with exactly this goal: toenable you to design and build any website that you can think of, not just copy the course project.

So, in order to become a confident and independent developer, capable of building your own websites in the future, you will learn:
The fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which will prepare you for the main course project (www.omnifood.dev). This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid!
How to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework I created just for this course. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more (this is like a small standalone course!).
How to use well-established website components and layout patterns in order to come up with professional-looking designs
How to make any website work on any mobile device, no matter the design and layout (responsive design)
How to use the 7 steps of building a professional website in practice: planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching
How to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons
Important developer skills such as reading documentation, fixing code errors on your own, and using professional web development tools
Does this sound like fun? Then join me and 200,000+ other developers and start building websites today!
Or are you not sold yet and need to know more? No problem, just keep reading...

[01] Why should you learn HTML and CSS in the first place?
Building websites allows you to dofun and creative work, from anywhere in the world, and it even pays well. Web development is one of themost future-proof and highest-paying industriesin the world. And HTML and CSS is the entry point to this world!
But you already know all this, that's why you want to learn HTML and CSS too. Well, you came to the right place!
This is the best and most complete course for starting your web development journey that you will find on Udemy. It's anall-in-one packagethat takes you from knowing nothing about HTML and CSS, to building beautiful websites using tools and technologies that professional web developers use every single day.

[02] Why is this course so unique and popular?
Reason #1: The course is completely project-based
Simple demos are boring, and therefore you're gonna learn everything bybuilding actual projects! In the final project (www.omnifood.dev), together we hand-code a beautiful and responsive landing page for afictional companythat I made up just for the course.

Reason #2: You will not just learn how to code
Coding is great, but it's not everything! That's why we will go through the entire7-step processof building and launching our website project.
So the huge Omnifood project will teach youreal-world skills to build real-world HTML and CSS websites: how to plan projects and page layouts, how to implement designs using HTML and CSS techniques, how to write clean and organized code, how to optimize websites for good speed performance, and many more.
On top of that, this course has ahuge focus on beautiful design. In fact, this is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together.

Reason #3: I'm the right teacher for you
With the right guidance and a well-structured curriculum, building websites can bequite easy and fun to learn. With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. And that's where I come in.
My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2015 to over 200,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.
Using that feedback, I recently rebuilt this course from scratch anddesigned the ideal course curriculumfor every type of student. It's aunique blendof projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges. I'm sure you're gonna love it!

[03] Why is this course so long?
Reason #1:I take time toexplain every single conceptthat I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen (this is a course, not a tutorial)
Reason #2:I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful!
Reason #3:There is a lot of repetition, so that you actuallyassimilate and practicewhat you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills

[04] Here is what's also included in the package:
Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business students)
Professional English captions (not the auto-generated ones)
Downloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section
Downloadable slides for 20+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)
Access to countless free design and development resources that I curated over many years
Free support in the course Q&A
10+ coding challenges to practice your new skills (solutions included)

[05] This course is for you if...
... you are a complete beginner with no idea of how to build a website.
... you already know a bit of HTML and CSS from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website.
... you are a designer and want to expand your skills into HTML and CSS, because all your designer friends are learning how to code (they are smart!).
Basically, if you are an HTML and CSS master, and build the most beautiful websites in the world, then DON'T take the course. Everyone else: you should take the course, today.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

1- Does this course cover ASP.NET Core 1.0?
No! Once you master ASP.NET MVC 5, you can quickly get up to speed with ASP.NET Core. Mosh has a follow up course on Udemy called ""Build a Real-world App with ASP.NET Core and Angular"". In this course, you'll get up to speed with ASP.NET Core in the context of building a real app from A to Z.

2- Why should I pay for this course when there are lots of free tutorials available?
Free tutorials and YouTube videos are free for a reason. They introduce you to a few concepts here and there, but soon you'll find yourself jumping from one tutorial to another to fill the missing gaps. By taking a perfectly-structured course, you'll be confident that you're in good hands, right from the beginning all the way through to the very end. You pay for saving your precious time: the time that you can spend on the things you love.
Plus, many of these free tutorials, including tutorials published by Microsoft on the official ASP.NET website, teach you poor practices. Throughout this course, Mosh points out some of these poor practices and explains in technical terms why you should avoid them.

1134456,"Create a Simple Photo Gallery with Dropzonejs, Slick and PHP","DropzoneJS is a helpful and open source tool designed to make uploading files to a website easier. It stands out because it lets you just drag and drop files into it, and it shows previews of images as soon as you upload them. This feature is especially useful for those who need to handle file uploads on their websites efficiently.
In this focused and short course, you will delve into how to use DropzoneJS effectively. The course is structured in a way that you will first learn how to integrate DropzoneJS into the front end of a website for uploading files. This means you'll be able to see how files, especially images, can be added to a website by simply dragging and dropping them into a designated area.
The course also covers the use of PHP, a widely-used programming language, for processing these files on the back end. This means after the files are uploaded using DropzoneJS, PHP will take over to manage these files on the server.
A key part of the course involves learning how to check (or validate) files during the upload process. This is crucial for ensuring that only the right types of files are uploaded and that they meet certain criteria, like size or format.
Another exciting aspect of this course is teaching you how to create a photo gallery. This isn't just any gallery, but one that uses the slick carousel - a popular tool for making sliding image displays. You'll learn how to control which images appear in this slider through an admin panel. This includes setting conditions for displaying certain images and also the ability to delete images from the gallery.
However, to take this course, you need to have a PHP development environment already set up on your computer.",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/create-a-simple-photo-gallery-with-dropzonejs-slick-and-php/,False

This method works well for round-trip applications, but it isn't a good way to do authentication in modern single page apps, like those built with AngularJS.
In this course we are going to learn about the challenges associated with traditional authentication and how to use what is arguably the best alternative: the JSON Web Token.
Using that knowledge, we'll implement authentication in an AngularJS app that makes calls to an Express API. We'll cover how to address all the challenges associated with keeping a single page application in check when it comes to stateless authentication. This can be a tricky matter since the front end and backend apps are effectively separated, but we'll find out how to leverage our user's JWT to address the challenges.

1031780,Ready for Production with Spring Boot Actuator,"For far too many developers, running an application in production is an after thought. In big enterprises, as a developer, you write an application and then turn it over to another team. Someone else promotes your code into QA and then the operations guys eventually take your code to production.
Out of sight, out of mind right?
Wrong. Not so much anymore.
The age of DevOps has really brought developers and operations closer together.
Spring Boot has introduced a tremendous amount of functionality to the Spring Framework. If you are building modern Spring Framework applications, you're probably already using Spring Boot.
An awesome feature of Spring Boot is Spring Boot Actuator.
If you're a developer, Spring Boot Actuator brings you a set of tools you want to be using to help people in operations monitor your application.
Spring Boot Actuator is all about supporting and monitoring your application running production.
If you're in operations, Spring Boot Actuator is a set of tools you want your developers to enable in their Spring Boot projects.
Spring Boot Actuator is a set of tools for monitoring and managing Spring Boot Applications as they run in production.
As the industry moves towards microservices deployed in containers, automated monitoring becomes more and more important.
Out of the box Spring Boot Actuator provides a health endpoint which can easily be wired into container orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes or Open Shift, which can be used to trigger alerting or automated self-healing.
But Spring Boot Actuator is much more than just a simple health endpoint.
In this courseyou will learn:
About the available Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.
How you can write your own custom endpoints.
How to use Spring MVC to expose endpoints via HTTP.
About the out of the box health checks provided by Spring Boot Actuator.
How to write your own custom health check.
How to show Git commit information on the Information endpoint.
How to show build information on the Information endpoint.
How to see system health metrics (memory, cache hits, disk usage, etc)
How to add metrics to see your application activity (page views, or other custom actions)
How to change log levels at runtime to aid troubleshooting.
When things go wrong in production, wouldn't it be nice to know exactly what version of your code is running?
With Spring Boot Actuator, it's simple to add information from your Git checkin or your Jenkins CI build. Then, you can go to the information endpoint and know exactly what version of the code is running in production.
As you troubleshoot a problem, sometimes you need to see more detailed log output.
If you're running in production, your logging levels are probably turned down to keep the logging overhead at a minimum.
What you need is a way to shell into your running application and change the log levels.
In this course, you will see exactly how you can shell into your running application to adjust the log levels.
If you're deploying Spring Boot applications in today's enterprise, Spring Boot Actuator is really a must have.",Intermediate Level,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/ready-for-production-with-spring-boot-actuator/,True
511934,AngularJS For Beginners,"HTML works perfectly fine as far as static documents are concerned. If a web application requires dynamic views however, it's less than ideal. That's where AngularJS comes in; an open-source framework that extends HTML vocabulary for you application, resulting in intuitive, expressive single page applications. For an AngularJS crash course to get you up to speed with this widely used framework, look no further.
Create flawless Single Page Applications with Angular JS

Build frameworks with a versatile, cutting edge toolset
Although only officially released in 2012, AngularJS has taken the world by storm thanks to official support from Google, a community of developers constantly improving it, and some of the internet's biggest websites making use of it. One of its best features is its data binding; dynamic views are automatically updated whenever a model changes, and vice versa. Furthermore, it combines the benefits of deep linking with desktop app-like behaviors, allows you to invent new HTML syntax and is designed to be testable. The result is simplified development and testing of applications and, ultimately, faultless single page and hybrid applications.
Course Overview
This AngularJS crash course is aimed at those who already have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript, but who may have limited experience of AngularJS projects. With 3 hours of content and over 50 lectures, it's a fast and efficient way to get yourself up to speed with this framework and start using it in the real world.
This course will allow you to grasp the basic concepts of AngularJS and its main features. You'll be provided with functional examples throughout to compound your learning, giving you the opportunity to put it to practical use.
After an overview of environment setup and MVC architecture, you'll get to grips with the more complex attributes of AngularJS, including modules and dependency injection, controllers, expressions, directives, scopes, filter, routing, and two-way data binding.
From Section 4 onwards, you'll build up a framework for your own dynamic app using bootstrap layouts, filters, list routing and setting parameters. You'll learn how to add useful functions like adding, updating and deleting elements, form validation and more. You'll even tackle debugging with Chrome console and add custom directives to make your HTML as readable as it can be.
By the end of the course, you will be confident enough to begin your own AngularJS projects, using the framework for creating web and hybrid applications of your own. You will have solidified your understanding of the AngularJS language and will be more than capable of putting to real world use with immediate effect.",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/angularjs-for-beginners-udemy/,False

1158836,PHP Specialist (2017 Edition),"This completes it...
PHP is the stepping stone to your first professional development gigs
PHP is the most popular back end language on the web.
Companies like Facebook and Tumblr use PHP as their primary back end coding language. It's in universal demands, and, as a new developer you're expected to know you're way around the front end and the back end.  That's where PHP comes in.
There was a time when a web developer could get away with knowing just HTML and some Javascript-- but now as employers are looking for more value, you have to know more.  PHP lets you access an entire world of backend databases, like mySQL which is introduced in this course.
FACT:  With PHP knowledge you'll be able to complete more advanced projects and be more employable.
People ask all the time:What's the best past to becoming a professional developer?
People going in to web development need two types of technical knowledge. First, they need to know how to manipulate content in a browser.  That's where HTML5 and Javascript come in.  But they also need to be able to interact with backend systems-- like eCommerce systems, databases and content management systems.

Derek Sivers, founder of CDBaby, is a coding entrepreneur. He learned how to do it all from scratch and launched a multi-million dollar marketplace to help artists everywhere get their CDs sold.
This was 1998. Before most current web technologies and great frameworks like Django.
Sivers is an unusual coding entrepreneur because he never really considered himself a ""programmer"" or ""entrepreneur"" -- instead, Sivers saw there was something he wanted to do and figured out how to do it.
The word ""Entrepreneur"" is thrown around so much and has even spawned the word ""Wantrapreneur"" for those who talk but never take action.
It's time to throwaway the notion and labels. All we need is action.
This course, is the pinnacle of the Coding for Entrepreneurs series.  We've learned so much from the 85k+ strong CFE community, that has help shaped this class into a improved version of the original.

736250,Mastering Thymeleaf with Spring,"Thymeleaf is a highly popular templating engine to use with Spring MVC to produce rich, and dynamic web pages.
Unlike other options available for Java and Spring Boot, Thymeleaf has a natural templating language - meaning you can view the templates right in your favorite browser. This really helps accelerate your development process.
Try doing that with JSP!
In this course you are guided step by step in building an ecommerce like web application using Thymeleaf, Spring MVC, and Spring Boot.
The focus of the course is on building web content with Thymeleaf. You start off the course building web pages using Bootstrap CSS. These are simple web pages you can view right in your browser. (No Spring Boot or Spring MVC - yet!) This is to give you a good overview of Bootstrap CSS, one of the most popular CSS frameworks in use today!
Next, you build the HTML for a product catalog website. Just the HTML to show a product listing and product detail pages.
Then we take your HTML pages and convert them into Thymeleaf templates. We add the templates into a Spring Boot application. Spring Boot will auto-configure Spring MVC to render the Thymeleaf templates under Tomcat.
You get to see how we transition the HTML documents from simple HTML, into Thymeleaf Templates for the Spring Boot application.
Using Spring MVC, you are able to start introducing dynamic content into the Thymeleaf templates.
From here you get to explore using Thymeleaf with Spring Boot.
You get hands on examples of:
Externalizing Text properties
Using Spring MVC Internationalization with Thymeleaf
Using Thymeleaf Fragments for common page components.
Leveraging Spring Boot Developer tools to speed up your development
Rendering POJOs returned from Spring MVC under Thymeleaf
Looping over lists in Thymeleaf
Using Thymeleaf fragments with lists
Thymeleaf expression syntax
Spring MVC validation with Thymeleaf
Using Spring Security with Thymeleaf
How to show different content to logged in users vs anonymous users
While the course does use the Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Security - these are not the primary topics of the course.
If you are a Spring Framework developer, used to JSPs (Java Server Pages) and wishing to get up to speed on Thymeleaf this is a perfect course for you! You'll never want to use JSPs again!
Even if you are not a Spring Framework developer, you will still get a lot out of this course! Thymeleaf is a powerful templating technology for Java and Spring. With Spring Boot it becomes very easy to develop rich dynamic content!",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/mastering-thymeleaf-with-spring/,True

You probably also have seen and read reports about internet security breaches that occur, but you probably think that your site is too small to have a serious problem.

Modern security attacks aren't confined to defacing websites and stealing information, sophisticated groups of professional hackers are actively building up networks of millions of compromised websites.  They collect these sites to use as large scale attacks and cause serious damage.

What you will gain from taking this course
This course will show you how to find and register your very own unique domain name and setup a web hosting account. It will also guide you through the process of creating your first web page. You will also learn how to edit web pages using different methods, and manage your files on your hosting account and your local computer.

You don't need to know anything about domains, hosting, HTML, CSS, or Jquery
We will start at the beginning and go through the process step-by-step. The course is structured in a logical way so you can follow along with each lecture and end up with your own website that is hosted online and located at your personal domain name.

After taking this course you will be able to:
Why should you take this course?
You should take this course if you are new to websites and want a simple, straightforward guide to getting started. This is also a perfect course for people who had someone else create their website but now you're stuck because you want to make simple edits and changes but don't know how to.

Course Structure:

Who Shouldn't Take This Course
Advanced web developers, or other people who have repeated experience registering domain names, setting up hosting accounts, and creating or editing web pages.

About Me
I started building websites over 14 years ago when I went to college for Computer Technology. Since then I have been designing and developing sites for friends, family and business clients. At times it has been my full-time job, and other times I have been more of a part-time consultant. My work has ranged from simple, static websites for individuals and small businesses up to complicated web applications for Universities. Because my work has been so diverse there is a good chance I will be able to relate to your situation and quickly be able to answer any questions that you have.

Why I made this course
1. To Show You How to Edit and Manage Your Existing Site
One reason I created this course is because I know quite a few folks who decided it was time to give their small business an online storefront and because they had no idea about the basic steps required to set up a website they spent a LOT OF MONEY at web design firms only to be stuck with a site they didn't know how to edit or manage. And my clients have complained to me that their hosting companies are constantly UPPING THEIR FEES but they don't know how to set up a different account.
2. To Explain When You Should Use an Existing Platform
Other people aren't sure if they need to use and eCommerce platform like Shopify or a blogging platform like Wordpress. So I wanted to explain when you should use them.
3. To Walk You Through the Nuts and Bolts of Setting Up Your First Website
And lastly, some of my clients and friends just want to set up a simple website but they just don't know where to start. There are many tutorials about how to code, but you really have to dig through boring help files to understand the nuts and bolts of setting everything up.

This course is created for you and intended to be a valuable resource
I will be available to answer any questions and even add additional content and lectures as needed.

Supplemental material
The course also has a comprehensive links to help you navigate through the ins and outs of setting up your website. Additionally the course will demonstrate the tools and services I use so you know how they work.

Bonus material
I recently published a book that goes beyond this course and discusses how to get your business started online and what it will take to be profitable.
THE COURSE INCLUDES A WAY FOR YOU TO GET THIS BOOK FOR FREE!

Curriculum Overview
1.How to find and register a unique domain name:
There are a lot of options out there for where to register your domain. Which one should you use? How does it work? What is the science behind domain names?I answer all these questions in this lecture, and when we are done you will be able to register your own domain name quickly and cheaply.
2.Simple instructions for setting up a hosting account for less than $49/year:
It is really hard to narrow down which hosting company to use, and even if you look at review lists of Best Hosting Companies it is hard to pick a winner. Then you try to set up an account and get a lot of nasty up-selling and confusing price structures. Later you find out the discounted prices at some companies go way up after the first year and you end up spending more year over year than you would have elsewhere!I will help you sort through the confusion and give you some tips on how to avoid all the up-selling and price changes, and I show you some companies that provide great service at good prices with less pressure.
3.Tutorial on pointing a domain name to a separate hosting account:
If you purchase a domain and hosting service from separate companies (I'll show you how and why you might want to) you have to connect them.I'll show you how to do it in no time!
4. Options for purchasing a combined domain + hosting solution:
If you want to save money during your first year, you can get a free domain with your hosting service.I'll quickly walk you through the process.
5.Step-by-step guide to create your first basic web page using different methods:
We won't go in to depth on how to write code, many people on Udemy have done that quite well.But I will show you how to create a basic web page, and more importantly I will show you where to find FREE help resources and examples, even a free sandbox, that will help you learn more and more on your own.
6.How to edit web pages right on your hosting account or from your computer:
This is designed specifically for folks who had someone else build them a website, but now every time they want to make an edit they have to call up the web design company. Even if it's just to change one word! That's outrageous.I will show you how you can do it yourself.
7.Instructions for uploading files to your hosting account:Want to build webpages on your computer?I'll show you how to get them online and show you how to use a free tool that makes it a breeze.
8.Options for when you may not want to create your own website:
Sometimes it makes more sense to use a full-service platform that has professional templates and packages so you don't have to create your own web pages.I'll discuss my favorite ones and tell you when and when not to use them.(Even if you are already planning to go this route you may want to take this course because it will still be helpful to know how to register your own unique domain name)
9.A look into more advanced topics:
Curious about whether you can actually make a sophisticated, professional website from scratch?You can and I'll show you some examples to whet your appetite.
10.Case Study that ties all the sections together:
In the Case Study we will actually purchase a domain name, set up hosting for the domain, link it to our hosting account. Then we will create a basic web page (NO CODE) for the website and view it live online. Later we will go back and edit that same web page, add pictures to it, put an Amazon Affiliate Link on it, embed a YouTube video on it and perform basic text and font edits. Lastly we will install WordPress and put a PayPal button on the site.

890810,Practical Understanding of PHP and MySQL,"Having thought for over 10 years at college level, I bring to you what is missing for free. To gain or acquire knowledge, you need to understand the concept of the topic, how it's used and when to use it. Most teachers are not doing that. Teaching is an art, it involves more than just taking screen shots or videos of what you are doing and telling people to do it with you.
Teaching involve explanations. You may follow an instructor to build a very cool app but would you be able to do it again by yourself? Only if you understood. You need to understand a topic before you can practice how it's used, but if you used it without understanding it, then you are not learning it. Take this course and learn to understand PHP. Convert abstract text to programmable meanings.

326244,"Installing Wordpress 4 - Installation, Registrars & Hosting","Installing Wordpress - Installation, domain registrars and web hostingis a course designed to give complete beginners all the knowledge and skills they need to install Wordpress on any web host.
We'll discuss domain registrars and web hosting, and see why it is better to use two separate companies for this, rather than relying on your web host to act as both host and registrar.  If that statement confuses you, don't panic.  I'll explain how to set all of this up, with videos and PDFs to help every step of the way.  I'll even show you how to move a domain you already own to a separate domain registrar.
We'll look at two automated ways of installing Wordpress, plus a manual method using FTP for those that like adventure.  I'll tell you which automated method is better, and why.
Once Wordpress is installed, we'll clean up the installation to remove the ""fluff"" that Wordpress installed.  We'll look at adding posts and pages, and talk about the main differences between these two types of document.
One of the reasons I love Wordpress is the simplicity of changing the look and feel of the site using themes.  We'll see how to find and install specific themes that meetyourcriteria, as well as how to install premium themes in case you buy one.
One of the most powerful features of Wordpress is the way it can be extended using plugins, which add new features and capabilities to an already powerful content management system.  We'll look at finding and installing plugins (both free and premium), and I'll tell you some of the free plugins I use on most of my sites.
Finally, for those that want a 100% free Wordpress site, I'll show you how to create one. There are limitations to this type of Wordpress site, but hey, it's free, right?  I'll let you know what you can and cannot do with these free sites.
By the end of this course, you will be able to install Wordpress on any web host, using a separate domain registrar,and understand why that is important.",Beginner Level,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/installing-wordpress-domain-registrars-and-web-hosting/,True

I may not be able to look at your code and tell you what's wrong. I will if I can, but keep in mind that I may not be able to spend too much time debugging your code.
If you're looking for advanced topics, you may want to download the source code of this course first and see if you could produce it on your own.
But, if you want to add Django to your tool belt - remember it's used on some of the busiest sites on the net - and you haven't yet taken the official tutorial, you need to download this course this minute.

1191946,Getting Started with Angular 2+,"Want to learn how to build apps with Angular 2? Let's build one together!
Angular is arguably the most popular framework in the world for building single page applications. You may have heard that Angular version 2 is completely different from the original AngularJS, and this is indeed the case. While this can cause frustration for developers who are upgrading their apps, it is ultimately for the best because Angular 2 is so much nicer to work with!
Part of the challenge when it comes to learning Angular 2 is that we need to adopt several new peripheral skills in addition to learning features of the framework itself. For example, most Angular 2 applications are written in a newer language called TypeScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript (meaning that it's just like JavaScript, but with additional features,) but learning it can initially be a challenge.
In this course we'll get down to basics with Angular 2. We'll get a really good sense of how to use it by building outng2-cribs, a real estate listing application that allows users to view listings, search and filter them, and add new ones in.

This course is about building web apps by learning web engineering and Python programming at the same time. We will be using a framework called Web2py which was created to make learning programming easy and enjoyable. But Web2py has also become a popular framework because it has turned out to be fast, scalable and that it allows for extreme developer productivity.

My personal love for Web2py grew from the fact that I literally became ten times more productive compared to when I was trying to get my head around another popular but really hard to learn framework called Django. I hope you will feel the same taking this course.
This course uses a heavy mix of videos, short texts to reinforce what you already have seen in the videos and a lot of quizzes to keep your brain attention on where it should be: learning.
I assume you know nothing about programming or building websites, but that you have a hunger to start building stuff online, and you can't wait to get your first app online today.
Many courses take a dictionary approach to teaching programming throwing a book with commands out of context. This course is not one of them. We all know that learning things out of context has a bad smell and doesn't result in competence.
This course is thus built around mini-projects resulting in small apps that we connect to each other. We will focus on the stuff most courses forget, such as engineering principles and writing good code. This means learning to analyse problems, rapid design process, writing automated tests and writing code that is easy to maintain and much much more.

Reading for parents
Do your kids spend too much time on the computer, phone or tablet? Don't you wish they could do something more productive? Why not get them to learn a life long valuable skill that will lead them into a career that pays 2 times the national average?
Programming is the new math.The average computer programmer makes78k a yearand there will always be a need for programmers. The only problem is that all of the educational courses are not tailored towards the learning styles of children. Most of the documentation is geared towards people over 18.
This course shows kids how to code by adapting the material to their learning styles. There are animated lectures, informative screencasts and tests. The first portion of the course introduces a lot of data and terminology quickly. You'll jump right in. No second is wasted in this action-packed, captivating course.
""SO FUN!!""
More and more people are learning to code, so do you want your kids to not have the same opportunities as others? This course offers your kids a competitive advantage.
Employers look for technical skills and applicants that can code are more attractive to hire. Even if the job isn't technical it always helps to have that technical knowledge to communicate with the technical team. Personally, I like to hire people with programming skills. If they are artists, video editors, or social media marketers, I generally prefer to hire people with programming experience.
About me, the instructor
My name is John Bura and I have run the software company Mammoth Interactive. We have had a ton of sales on our software which includes XBOX 360, iPad and iPhone games. On top of this I have been teaching people full time since I was 17. With the combination of teaching experience and real world experience, I have a truly unique experience that you can't find anywhere else.

309820,ASP.Net MVC Quick Start,"This course is a very quick workshop to take you through the basic actions that will be required for you to create an awesome, real-world CRUD web application in just a few hours (you could do it over a weekend very easily) using ASP .Net MVC, the Entity Framework (code-first development approach), and the built-in scaffolding capabilities of ASP .Net MVC.In the end, you'll have your own public-facing website to enhance your resume and show off your skills in your own e-portfolio for job interviews and applications!
MVC = Model, View, Controller, and is a well-known and established design pattern.  Microsoft has made it extremely easy and convenient to create your web solutions using this pattern.  In Microsoft's MVC framework, we find that convention is favored over configuration, so as long as we follow a few simple guidelines, the system will do a lot of the work for us.
We'll also be taking a quick look at how we can use the Entity Framework to easily model and create a database for us.  By using the code-first approach, we'll simply create our models and then look at writing a DBContext to store the models.  We'll also look at some of the more critical operations, such as building relationships and seeding our data.
After we've learned about the different aspects of our application, we'll quickly create a couple of controllers and use ASP .Net MVC's built-in view and scaffolding generators to easily build our CRUD operations against our database.   While working on controllers we'll also look at Authentication, Authorization, and a couple of other quick security concerns.
To make the solution more robust, we'll learn about using repository and service layers to separate concerns, while also keeping our models and data in their own projects.  We'll also implement integration and unit testing around these layers using XUnit, Shouldly, Moq, and in-memory databases.
After creating the backend portion of the site, we'll put DataTables.js on our Index view so that we can easily show the data, as well as provide built-in JavaScript tools that will filter and sort the data for us.  This will make your application ""pop"" when people look at it because it will be fast and easy to sort through the data and filter for results.
Other things we will learn throughout the course involve the use of GIT for source control, pushing our repository to GitHub, and utilizing CI/CD through GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your solution to Azure.  With Azure being free now, you can easily utilize the robust platform solutions available at Azure without spending any money.  You'll gain experience setting up an Azure app service, configuring the connection string to connect to your Azure SQL server and database, and you'll learn about utilizing Azure Application Insights to  monitor your application, including writing your own custom events and exception handling.
By the end of the course, you'll be familiar with the major working parts of creating an ASP .Net MVC CRUD application and publishing to a public-facing website with a fairly nice and responsive UI.  You'll have working knowledge of Models, Views, and Controllers, as well as how they interact to create a functional web application.  You'll also be exposed to the Entity Framework and Code First Migrations with use of a SQL Server backend.  The best part is that although this sounds pretty daunting, it's actually quite easy with a majority of the work done for us by convention and tools.",Intermediate Level,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/aspnet-mvc-quick-start/,False

JavaScript is a programming language that can be run by all modern web browsers. It is downloaded alongside the HTML code of a webpage. Unlike HTML, which can only be used to display content, JavaScript allows web designers to add functionality and interactivity to their websites.
JQuery is a popular JavaScript library that is used extensively in modern websites.

In addition to its easy-to-use features, JQuery also takes care of many cross-browser compatibility issues automatically.
AngularJS is basically a JavaScript framework (an open source web application framework) library, which is distributed as JavaScript file. Mainly used in developing Single Page Application (SPA). It extendes HTML with additional new attributes hence making simple development and making it more responsive at user’s end, since HTML was never design for dynamics views.

I took alot of courses on Udemy, this is the first time i feel that i must leave such a rating because simply it deserves more than that .. the instructor answered all my questions faster than i even imagined and was more than clear and helpful, beside it is very explanatory for a beginner like me (other course i took claimed that no prior knowledge is required but i discovered later that i was in a total mess because i don’t have prior knowledge in bootstrap to an extent that i left the whole course).The usage of pencode was an excellent idea because it shows for beginners (Like me) the effect of each class alone before applying the next class. The course is rich with alot of learning hours that concentrates on the pure bootstrap classes before engaging in projects (I hope all courses do this, i dunno why all courses today just dig into projects without deeply explaining the core of the skill), All the previous made me dig into the course faster than i imagined .i hope the instructor can make more courses ( I would highly appreciate a course of modern Html5 that contains deep explanation for Aria and modern accesibility attributes).– Karim Usama

If you've always wanted to build webpages, but were intimidated by the code, this course will help you learn your first two languages quickly and easily.
Taking a step-by-step approach, this course will have you learning by doing, building several mini-websites from scratch.
Every webpage that you see on the net is built using a language or code. There are many different programming languages that can make your website do various things, but the two most important to learn are HTML and CSS. In fact, even people who plan on allowing someone else to build their website should have a basic grasp of both languages. This way you can tweak things behind the scenes, or change some of your formatting without having to always rely on others.
This course of more than 35 lectures and 4 hours of content gives you a basic, yet thorough understanding of both HTML and CSS. The course focuses on having you begin writing code right away so you can learn through doing, and build your own completely functional HTML and CSS webpages with our lectures and especially at the end of each section with our Portfolio Projects.
You'll begin by learning what HTML and CSS are, so you can get an understanding of what it is that they do. During the course you'll build several mini-websites that take what it is that you've learned and apply it to real world exercises to help cement the skills.
Everyone from aspiring web designers to bloggers, programmers to business owners can benefit from learning some HTML and CSS. Learn to begin building your own dynamic webpages or manage the page that you already have. If you plan on becoming a web programmer or a web designer yourself, HTML and CSS are the first two languages you'll need to succeed. In fact HTML is required for anyone that wants to get into web development from any angle. Learning it simultaneously with CSS allows you to hit the ground running with page design.",Beginner Level,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/intro-to-html-and-css-basics/,True

However many programmers learn object orientation programming instead of the whole object orientation  process, for example what do we mean by object orientation? What does the APIE acronym stand for and do we understand all concepts of this acronym? Those who may even have a general knowledge of object orientation programming may want to take this course because it'll give a higher definition of object orientation and all concepts that surround it. To truly understand how to program in an object oriented manner then we must first understand all there is to know about the concepts, ideologies and fundamental understanding not just the syntax of any one language.
If you just know how to program object oriented then that will not cut it. What happens when you need to map out an application are you using UML and are you using it correctly? Everything we do in the programming world is for real world use so understanding the syntax only or understanding object orientation in a general way will not cut in large scale projects. So those programmers who may have been exposed to object orientation  syntax may find this course of some use and don't for object oriented analyse and design don't refer to any programming language. Also new comers will definitely learn a boat load from this course in the simplest manner possible right from the start even if you don't want to do the programming part.

Also, does creating sound design pattern for your apps seem a little difficult? Shouldn’t there be a better way for writing codes where a little code can perform a herculean task? There is! It’s object-oriented JavaScript.
JavaScript works well with OOP (object-oriented programming) because of three major techniques that simplify coding for developers – Inheritance, Polymorphism and Encapsulation.
Object-oriented programming also allows developers to contain pieces of codes that can be encapsulated within an object, which can then be called numerous times in the application without having to write the code again. Another benefit of OOP JavaScript is prototype-based inheritance, compared to classes based, which allows an object to directly inherit from another object.
You will learn how to maximize your code using OOP and JavaScript, as well as so much more in this comprehensive course.
In our object-oriented JavaScript course, you will learn how to perfectly blend the practicality of object-oriented programming with the functionality of JavaScript to write codes that are clean, concise and perform exactly the way you want them to.
The course will begin with a quick refresher on JavaScript and its basic fundamentals, with an emphasis on important concepts such as closures and prototypes. It will then progress to understanding object-oriented programming principles and how they can be integrated with JavaScript. You will also learn OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, etc. and how they can be used to enhance your JavaScript codes.
The tutorial will also include how OOP and JavaScript will perform in browsers with reference to Document Object Model (DOM) and Browser Object Model (BOM). The course comes packed with many coding examples, which the learners are definitely encouraged to try on their own.

Well then, look no further, because this Learning Path takes you on a journey to learning all about Elasticsearch, the renowned open source search engine that helps power searches within thousands of websites worldwide, and much more.
Elasticsearch is part of the Elastic family, popularly called as the Elastic stack, whose other components include Logstash, Kibana, the Beats family, and X-Pack.
Together, the Elastic stack forms an essential suite of tools that is a must for any developer wanting to embark on a path to build high-quality web applications in this day and age. Elasticsearch is a search server that can also double up as a NoSQL data store, and hence provides lightning-fast search functionality within a website. Logstash is used to collect and parse all kinds of logs. It can also be used to ferry data to and from Elasticsearch at high speeds. Kibana is an Elasticsearch data visualization tool, Beats help in gathering data from disparate sources to Elasticsearch, while X-Pack provides services such as security, monitoring, alerting, reporting, and so on.
The Road to Elasticsearchis Packt’s Video Learning Path that is a series of individual video products put together in a logical and stepwise manner such that each video builds on the skills learned in the video before it.
First, this learning path gets you acquainted with the new, Elastic stack. You learn all about the key components of the Elastic family, their usage and their significance. Then, we move on to a more detailed topic in which we learn in depth about the new Elasticsearch 5.0, which is the mainstay of the stack. We begin by learning about the fundamentals of Elasticsearch. Here, we learn how data is stored in Elasticsearch, specifically, concepts like index, types, and documents, and are also introduced to the Elasticsearch domain-specific language (DSL). Finally, we learn to create complex search queries that power advanced search features in top websites.
By the end of this Learning Path , you will have developed a mastery of Elasticsearch fundamentals, and  would be able to seamlessly harness the power of Elasticsearch to augment the capability of your web apps.
The goal of this Learning Path is to equip you with strong fundamentals of Elasticsearch and introduce you to the Elastic stack.

Please note: The level for this course is set to ""Intermediate Level"" because you must know how to set up and install Drupal locally.
Drupal is a powerful CMS and can be used to create all sorts of websites. What makes it unique is how it’s built and customized.
When building websites using other CMSs, if you need some specific functionality, let’s say a business directory portal, you’ll often find a plugin which implements the functionality end-to-end. But if you want to modify something often these plugins, in other CMSs, they are difficult to customize.
Drupal does things differently.
Instead of offering a packaged business directory you’ll build the functionality yourself piece by piece. Similar to how you build something using Lego blocks.
Building the functionality yourself is favorable because you get exactly what you want; nothing more, nothing less. It means you can implement custom business requirements much easier.
Building things from scratch means you have to understand the fundamental parts of Drupal. You’ll need to know how content is stored, rendered and displayed in lists or blocks.
If you don’t have this basic understanding you’ll hit a roadblock very quickly.
You need to have a fundamental understanding of Drupal
Not having a proper understanding of Drupal’s fundamental system can really hurt a project.
Let’s say a client wants to use Drupal and at the beginning of the project you provide a proposal and estimate. If you’re not experienced with Drupal, and try to estimate, then your final estimate could be way off, which could hurt you financially.
If you’ve inherited a site which was built by inexperienced site builders then maintaining it will be difficult because functionality wasn’t built to Drupal’s best practices.
Bottom line, it’ll cost you time and money.
Learn how to build Drupal sites using best practices
This course will give you a solid understanding of Drupal’s key systems.
By the end, you would’ve built a fully functional site and you’ll have the knowledge to customize till your heart's content.
The skills you learn here will help you estimate and write proposals for any Drupal project because you understand the key systems.",All Levels,Web Development,https://www.udemy.com/drupal-8-site-building/,False

An HTML Form is made of one or more input elements. Those input elements can be text fields (single line or multiline), select boxes, buttons, checkboxes, or radio buttons. Most of the time, those input elements are paired with a label that describes their purpose.

270976,A how to guide in HTML,"***Lite Edition***
Hello and welcome to this short course on HTML, which is the language of the World Wide Web!
Why Learn HTML?
HTML is the language of the Web. In other words, HTML is the computer language on which the web (Internet) is built. Yet, it is simple and easy to learn and its basic rules are easy to pick up and put to use. HTML is a tool, an investment for life, and once you know how to use it, you are limited only by your imagination.
Course Mission:
The mission of this short course is to provide a quick and accessible way for you to learn HTML from ground up and also use it as a quick basic reference guide wherever and whenever you want. I hope that this course fills in multiple roles as both a learning tool and a basic reference once you expand your skills.

Course Rundown (What makes this course different?):
Each lecture in this course is independent of the other lectures in the course. That is you do not need to follow a linear learning path, which is to start at the very first lecture and end at the last. Just think of this course as a multipurpose tool – perhaps the Swiss Army Knife of HTML language. That is because, not only can you employ this course to learn HTML from scratch but you can also use it as a basic reference whenever you want to review a certain basic topic in the HTML language. It starts with the basics of HTML and builds up to give you a solid background on the basics of HTML.
Lecture Break-down:
How to write tags in HTML?
This lecture will introduce the concept of tags in HTML and will show you how easy it is to write tags in HTML
How to use Windows Notepad Editor to Create HTML Files?
Just in case you do not already know how to setup the environment to work with HTML files, this lecture will take your right through to setup Windows Notepad and show you how you can create HTML files
How to structure an HTML document?
At the heart of every HTML document are the basic underlying elements that form a webpage. This lecture will introduce you to these elements gradually and get you ready to create your first webpage in HTML
How to create Headings?
In this lecture, you will learn how you can create headings on your webpage similar to the headings you see in newspapers, magazines etc.
How to create Paragraphs?
Almost 50 - 80% of all of your webpages will contain text and this lecture does the same – it will guide you through to place paragraphs on your webpage
How to insert/embed images?
A lot of times you may want to make your webpage look beautiful by adding images to it. This lecture will show you exactly the same – it will walk you through to place images on your webpage
Supplementary Files:
Each lecture in this course contains additional supplementary files in the supplementary file section, in order for you to understand the concepts better. In case you want to download a zipped folder of these files, kindly send me a message and I will send you a link to download the zipped folder.
Feedback (Please help me to make this course even better!):
I’m constantly working on to improve this course. Therefore, if you have any feedback you are welcome to send me a message and I will definitely work on to include that in this course.
Premium Edition:The premium edition of this course will contain a complete coverage of the entire HTML language.

679992,Building Better APIs with GraphQL,"This course teaches you everything you need to know about GraphQL. GraphQL was open sourced by Facebook in 2015 and is a fresh new approach to API development.
GraphQL will replace REST in the coming years. Don't just take my word for it though, here's what some other folks on Twitter are saying:
""Just watched a talk on GraphQL, I want this thing and I want it by yesterday"" –@sunesimonsen
""I long for the day when GraphQL will be the new API standard.""–@xinron
""GraphQL is the King. Long Live the King! (R.I.P. REST)"" –@scbarrus
––––––––––––––––––––––
About this course:

What you'll learn:
So you've read this far! Thank you.
One final and important point
If you've ever had trouble working with REST in the past, it's not your fault. It's been the recommended way of building APIs since 1996. There are countless articles on creating ""thoughtful RESTful APIs"", but none of them ever seem to apply to what you're working on. GraphQL offers a way out of this madness.
I've been running a GraphQL server in production for the last 3 months and it's sped up our response time, simplified our architecture and made it easier to access our data. I am not alone. Many multi-million dollar companies are also seeing the benefits of GraphQL in production including the Financial Times, Artsy, and Facebook.
Let's get started. Click the ""Take this Course"" button in the top-right corner right now and I'll see you on the other side.
